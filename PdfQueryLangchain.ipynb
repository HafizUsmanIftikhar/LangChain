More\\nspecifically, it is about looking at the processes that make up a business enterprise\\nand seeing how ERP software can improve the performance of these business pro-cesses. ERP software is complicated and expensive. Unless a company uses it to\\nbecome more efficient and effective in delivering goods and services to its customers,\\nan ERP system will only be a drain on company resources.\\nOur experience in teaching about ERP systems has revealed that undergraduate\\nbusiness students do not always understand how businesses operate, and advancedundergraduate students— and even many MBA students —do not truly grasp the pro-\\nblems inherent in unintegrated systems. These students also do not comprehend\\nbusiness processes and how different functional areas must work together to achieve\\ncompany goals. As a result, many students do not understand how an informationsystem should help business managers make decisions.\\nConsequently, we set out to write a book that does the following:\\n\\x81Describes basic business functional areas and explains how they are related\\n\\x81Illustrates how unintegrated information systems fail to support business\\nfunctions and business processes that cut across functional area boundaries\\n\\x81Demonstrates how integrated information systems can help a company pros-\\nper by improving business processes and by providing business managers\\nwith accurate, consistent, and current data\\nWe have found that our focus on business processes has been well received.\\nThe Approach of This Book\\nA key feature of our book is the use of the fictitious Fitter Snacker Company, a man-\\nufacturer of nutritious snack bars, as an illustrative example throughout the book. We\\nshow how Fitter Snacker ’s somewhat primitive and unintegrated information systems\\ncause operational problems. We intentionally made the systems’ problems easy to\\nunderstand, so the student could readily comprehend them. Potential solutions forsolving integration problems are illustrated using SAP ’s ERP software.\\nThe fourth edition of Concepts in Enterprise Resource Planning reflects the\\ncurrent state of the ERP software market and other areas of the information technol-ogy market that affect ERP systems, while adding updated examples of how compa-nies are using integrated systems to solve business problems and achieve greater\\nsuccess. The book has eight chapters:\\n\\x81Chapter 1, “Business Functions and Business Processes, ”explains the pur-\\nposes for, and information systems requirements of, main business functional\\nareas —Marketing and Sales, Supply Chain Management, Accounting and\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

This chapter also describes how a business\\nprocess cuts across the activities within business functional areas and why\\nmanagers need to think about making business processes work.\\n\\x81Chapter 2, “The Development of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems, ”\\nprovides a short history of business computing and the developments that led\\nto today ’s ERP systems . Chapter 2 concludes with an overview of ERP issues\\nand an introduction to the SAP ERP software.\\n\\x81Chapter 3, “Marketing Information Systems and the Sales Order Process,”\\ndescribes the Marketing and Sales functional area, and it highlights the pro-\\nblems that arise with unintegrated information systems. To make concepts easy\\nto understand, the Fitter Snacker running example is introduced. After\\nexplaining Fitter Snacker ’s problems with its unintegrated systems, we show\\nhow an ERP system can help a company avoid these problems. Sample SAP ERP\\nscreens are used to illustrate the concepts. Because using ERP can naturally\\nlead a company into ever-broadening systems ’integration, a discussion of\\ncustomer-relationship management (CRM) software concludes the chapter.\\n\\x81Chapter 4, “Production and Supply Chain Management Information Systems, ”\\ndescribes how ERP systems support Supply Chain Management —the coordi-\\nnated activities of all the organizations involved in converting raw materials\\ninto consumer products on the retail shelf. As in Chapter 3, the problems\\ncaused by Fitter Snacker ’s unintegrated information system are explored,\\nfollowed by a discussion of how ERP software could help solve these problems.\\n\\x81Chapter 5, “Accounting in ERP Systems, ”describes accounting processes and\\nhow ERP systems support those processes. This chapter clearly distinguishes\\nbetween financial accounting (FI) and managerial accounting (CO) issues.Included is an overview of the Enron collapse and the resulting Sarbanes-\\nOxley Act along with the act ’s impact on information systems, specifically\\nmanagement controls and audit capabilities. XBRL —and its relationship to\\nERP systems and financial reporting —is explored, along with the transition to\\nthe IFRS accounting standards.\\n\\x81Chapter 6, “Human Resources Processes with ERP, ”covers human resource\\nmanagement. While the Human Resource software module is the leastintegrated component of all ERP systems, it includes numerous processes\\nthat are critical to a company ’s success, including strategic issues like\\nsuccession planning.\\n\\x81Chapter 7, “Process Modeling, Process Improvement, and ERP Implementation, ”\\nfirst presents flowcharting basics, followed by the highly structured EPC processmodel. Implementation issues conclude the chapter. We believe that process\\nimprovement, not large-scale implementation, should be the focus in an intro-\\nductory ERP course.\\n\\x81Chapter 8, “RFID, Business Intelligence (BI), Mobile Computing, and the\\nCloud, ”covers current technologies that are impacting ERP systems. In this\\nedition, the text covers radio frequency identification (RFID), business intel-ligence (BI) and in-memory computing, mobile computing, and the cloud.\\nBecause technology changes rapidly, this chapter provides an introduction to\\nthese current topics, rather than an exhaustive treatment of the subjects, andthe instructor will likely want to provide current supplements.xvi Preface\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Many of the exercises in the book require research for their\\nsolution, and the MBA student could do these in some depth.\\n\\x81The book could serve as an introductory text in a course devoted wholly to ERP.\\nItwould provide the student with a basis in how ERP systems help companies to\\nintegrate different business functions. The instructor might use Chapter 8 asthe starting point for teaching the higher-level strategic implications of ERP andrelated topics. The instructor can pursue these and related topics using his or\\nher own resources, such as case studies and current articles.\\n\\x81Because of the focus on fundamental business issues and business processes,\\nthebook can also be used in a sophomore-level Introduction to Business course.\\nExcept for a computer literacy course, we assume no particular educational or\\nbusiness background. Chapters 1 and 2 lay out most of the needed business and\\ncomputing groundwork, and the rest of the chapters build on that base.\\nFeatures of This Text\\nTo bring ERP concepts to life (and down to earth) this book uses sales, manufactur-ing, purchasing, human resources, and accounting examples for the Fitter Snacker\\ncompany. Thus, the student can see problems, not just at an abstract level, but withinthe context of a company ’s operations. We believe this approach makes business pro-\\nblems and the role ERP can play in solving them easier to understand.\\nThe book’ s exercises have the student analyze aspects of Fitter Snacker ’s infor-\\nmation systems in various ways. The exercises vary in their difficulty; some can be\\nsolved in a straightforward way, and others require some research. Not all exercises\\nneed to be assigned. This gives the instructor flexibility in choosing which concepts toemphasize and how to assess students ’knowledge. Some exercises explore Fitter\\nSnacker ’s problems, and some ask the student to go beyond what is taught in the\\nbook and to research a subject. A solution might require the student to generate aspreadsheet, perform calculations, document higher-level reasoning, present the\\nresults of research in writing, or participate in a debate.\\nThe book includes an additional element designed to bring ERP concepts to life:\\nAnother Look features, which are short, detailed case studies that focus on problemsfaced by real-world companies.\\nWe have illustrated ERP concepts and applications by showing how SAP ERP\\nwould handle the problems discussed in the book. Screen shots of key SAP ERP toolsare shown throughout to illustrate ERP concepts. Many of the book’ s exercises ask the\\nstudent to think about how a problem would be addressed using ERP software.Preface xvii\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

ERP (pronounced “E-R-P ”)\\nprograms help organizations manage company-wide business processes, using a common database\\nand shared management reporting tools. A business process is a collection of activities that takes\\none or more kinds of input and creates an output, such as a report or forecast, that is of value to the\\ncustomer. ERP software supports the efficient operation of business processes by integrating tasks\\nrelated to sales, marketing, manufacturing, logistics, accounting, and staffing —throughout a\\nbusiness. In addition to this cross-functional integration, which is at the heart of an ERP system,\\ncompanies connect their ERP systems, using various methods, to coordinate business processes\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

In later chapters, you will learn how successful businesspeople\\nuse ERP programs to improve how work is done within a company and between companies.\\nChapter 1 provides a background for learning about ERP software.\\nFUNCTIONAL AREAS AND BUSINESS PROCESSES\\nTo understand ERP, you must first understand how a business works. Let ’s begin by\\nlooking at a typical business ’s areas of operation. These areas, called functional areas of\\noperation , are broad categories of business activities.\\nFunctional Areas of Operation\\nMost companies have four main functional areas of operation: Marketing and Sales (M/S),\\nSupply Chain Management (SCM), Accounting and Finance (A/F), and Human Resources(HR). Each area is composed of a variety of narrower business functions , which are\\nactivities specific to that functional area of operation. Examples of the business functionsof each area are shown in Figure 1-1.\\nFunctional\\narea of\\noperationMarketing and\\nSalesSupply Chain\\nManagementAccounting and\\nFinanceHuman\\nResources\\nMarketing a\\nproductPurchasing\\ngoods and raw\\nmaterialsFinancial\\naccounting of\\npayments fromcustomers andto suppliersRecruiting and\\nhiring\\nTaking salesordersReceivinggoods and raw\\nmaterialsCost allocation\\nand controlTraining\\nCustomer\\nsupportTransportationand logisticsPlanning andbudgetingPayroll\\nCustomer\\nrelationshipmanagementSchedulingproduction runsCash-flowmanagementBenefits\\nSalesforecastingManufacturinggoodsGovernment\\ncompliance\\nAdvertising Plant\\nmaintenanceBusiness\\nfunctions\\nSource Line: Course Technology/Cengage Learning.\\nFIGURE 1-1 Examples of functional areas of operation and their business functions2Chapter 1\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.Historically, businesses have had organizational structures that separated the\\nfunctional areas. Business schools have been similarly organized, so each functional area\\nhas been taught as a separate course. In a company separating functional areas in this\\nway, Marketing and Sales might be completely isolated from Supply Chain Management,even though the Marketing and Sales staff sell what the employees in Supply Chain\\nManagement procure and produce. Thus, you might conclude that what happens in one\\nfunctional area is not closely related to what happens in others. As you will learn in thischapter, however, functional areas are interdependent, each requiring data from the\\nothers. The better a company can integrate the activities of each functional area, the\\nmore successful it will be in today’ s highly competitive enviro nment. The Association to\\nAdvance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) —the accreditation board of university\\nbusiness schools —is now promoting integration between functional areas of business for\\nhigher education.\\nIntegration also contributes to improvements in communication and workflow. Each\\narea’s information system depends on data from other functional areas. An information\\nsystem (IS) includes the people, procedures, software, and computers that store, organize,\\nanalyze, and deliver information. This chapter illustrates the need for information sharing\\nbetween functional areas and the effects on the business if this information is not\\nintegrated. In later sections, you will also see some examples of typical business processesand how these processes routinely cross functional areas.\\nBusiness Processes\\nMore managers are now thinking in terms of business processes rather than business\\nfunctions. Recall that a business process is a collection of activities that takes one or more\\nkinds of input and creates an output that is of value to the customer. The customer for abusiness process may be a traditional external customer (the person who buys the finished\\nproduct), or it may be an internal customer (such as a colleague in another department).\\nFor example, what is sold through Marketing and Sales is linked to what is procured andproduced by Supply Chain Management. This concept is illustrated in Figure 1-2.\\nSource Line: Course Technology/Cengage Learning.\\nFIGURE 1-2 Sample business processes related to the sale of a smartphone3Business Functions and Business Processes\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Consider the example illustrated in Figure 1-2 of a\\ncustomer who wants to purchase a new smartphone. The customer wants information\\nabout the company ’s products so she can select a smartphone and various high-tech\\naccessories for the phone. She wants to place her order quickly and easily, and perhaps\\neven arrange for financing through the company. She expects quick delivery of the correct\\nmodel of smartphone, and she wants 24-hour customer support for any problems. Thecustomer is not concerned about how the smartphone was marketed, how its components\\nwere purchased, how it was built, or how the delivery truck will find the best route to her\\nhouse. The customer wants the satisfaction of having the latest in mobile phonetechnology at a reasonable price.\\nBusinesses must always consider the customer ’s viewpoint in any transaction. What is\\nthe difference between a business function and a business process from the customer ’s\\npoint of view? Suppose the customer ’s mobile phone is damaged during shipment. Because\\nonly one functional area is involved in accepting the return of the damaged item, receiptof the return is a business function —specifically, it is part of the customer relationship\\nmanagement function of Marketing and Sales. Because several functional areas are\\ninvolved in the repair and return of the mobile phone back to the customer, the handling\\nof the repair is a business process . Thus, in this example, the customer is dealing\\nwith many of the company ’s functional areas in the process of buying and obtaining\\na smartphone.\\nA successful customer interaction is one in which the customer (either internal or\\nexternal) is not required to interact separately with each business function involved in the\\nprocess. If companies are not coordinating their business functions, a customer could\\nreceive conflicting information and likely would quickly become dissatisfied. Successfulbusiness managers view their business operations from the perspective of a satisfied\\ncustomer and strive to present one consistent (and positive) “face”to the customer.\\nFor the mobile phone company to satisf y its customers, it must make sure its\\nfunctional areas of operation are integrate d. Mobile phone technology changes rapidly,\\nand the devices the phone company sells change frequently. To provide customers with\\naccurate information, people performing the sales function must have up-to-dateinformation about the latest mobile phones available for sale; otherwise, a customer\\nmight order a smartphone that the company ’s manufacturing plant no longer produces.\\nPeople performing the manufacturing function need to receive the details of a customer ’s\\nsmartphone order quickly and accurately from the employee (or online ordering system)performing the sales function, so the right phone can be packaged and shipped on time\\nto the customer. If the customer is financi n gt h es m a r t p h o n et h r o u g ht h em o b i l ep h o n e\\ncompany, the employees performing the sales order function must gather information\\nabout the customer and process it quickly, so financing can be approved in time to\\nsupport shipping the phone.\\nSharing data effectively and efficiently between and within functional areas leads to\\nmore efficient business processes. Information systems that are designed so functionalareas share data are called integrated information systems . Working through this textbook\\nwill help you understand the benefits of integrated information systems and the problems\\nthat can occur when information systems are not integrated.

Figure 1-3 illustrates the process view of business operations.\\nBusinesses take inputs (resources) in the form of material, people, and equipment,\\nand transform these inputs into goods and services for customers. Effectively managingthese inputs and business processes requires accurate and up-to-date information. For\\nexample, the sales staff takes a customer ’s order, and production employees schedule the\\nmanufacturing of the product. Logistics employees schedule and carry out the delivery of\\nthe product. If raw materials are needed to make the product, production prompts\\npurchasing staff to arrange for their purchase and delivery. Logistics will receive the rawmaterial, verify its receipt to accounting so the vendor can be paid, and deliver the goodsto production. Throughout, accounting ke eps appropriate transaction records.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nIntegrated Information Systems\\nThe world today is information driven. Getting the right information to the right person\\ncan make a huge difference in terms of a company ’s bottom line. But are some systems\\njust too complicated to be fully integrated? Although the financial services industryspends more on information technology than any other industry ($500 billion worldwidein 2009), many financial institutions do not have fully integrated information systems.\\nWhy is this so? The reasons are many. Banks were the first organizations to adopt\\ninformation systems, so many of their systems are legacy (old) systems that would bedifficult and expensive to update. In addition, many banks have gone through multiplephases of acquisition, which in itself results in duplicate information systems.Government regulations on financial institutions have also brought about additional\\n(continued)Customer order processSales\\nfunction\\nAccounting\\nfunction\\nPurchasing\\nfunction\\nProduction\\nfunction\\nLogistics\\nfunction\\nMaterial order process\\nSource Line: Course Technology/Cengage Learning.\\nFIGURE 1-3 A process view of business operations5Business Functions and Business Processes\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

And many financial organizations write their own proprietary systems for\\nmarket trading, thinking that gives them a leg up on their competition. Some of the\\nmore sophisticated financial products, such as hedge funds and derivatives, are\\ngenerated via complex programs. In addition, a great deal of financial tracking isperformed on spreadsheets, which may not be connected to any integrated system.\\nThe end result of these unintegrated systems is a lack of consistent data across\\nsystems, which can lead to an inaccurate assessment of risk. Most financial systemswritten today are honed for rapid trading, not for regulation or for tracking anomaliesthat could lead to problems. Some IT experts claim that the global financial networks arenow unstable and that the fast quantitative trading programs in place could lead rapidlyto potentially disastrous outcomes.\\nQuestion:\\n1. Do you think some of the problems associated with the financial crisis of 2008\\ncould have been avoided if financial firms had more integrated information?If so, how, or if not, why not?\\nFUNCTIONAL AREAS AND BUSINESS PROCESSES\\nOF A VERY SMALL BUSINESS\\nNext, we will look at the way business processes involve more than one functional area,\\nusing a fictitious small business as an example —a coffee shop that you own. We will\\nexamine the business processes of the coffee shop and see why coordination of the\\nfunctional areas helps achieve efficient and effective business processes. You will see the\\nrole that information plays in this coordination and how integration of the informationsystem improves your business.\\nEven though just a few people can run a small coffee shop, the operation of the\\nbusiness requires a number of processes. Coordinating the activities within differentfunctional areas requires accurate and timely information.\\nMarketing and Sales\\nMarketing and Sales (M/S) functions include developing products, determining pricing,\\npromoting products to customers, and taking customers ’orders. Marketing and Sales also\\nhelps create a sales forecast to ensure the successful operation of the coffee shop.\\nFor the most part, this is a cash business, but you still need to keep track of your\\ncustomers so you can send flyers or occasional thank-you notes to repeat customers. Thus,your records must not only show the amount of sales, but also identify repeat customers.\\nProduct development can be done informally in such a simple business; you gather\\ninformation about who buys which kind of coffee and note what customers say about eachproduct. You also analyze historical sales records to spot trends that are not obvious.Deciding whether to sell a product also depends on how much it costs to produce the\\nproduct. For example, some customers might be asking for a fair-trade decaffeinated coffee\\nor a chai tea. To determine whether the new product could be profitably produced andsold, you could analyze data from Supply Chain Management, including production6Chapter 1\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Therefore,\\nalthough you run a cash business, good repeat customers are allowed to run up a tab —up\\nto a point. Thus, your records must show how much each customer owes as well as his or\\nher available credit. It is very important that the data be available and accurate at thetime of a customer ’s credit request. Since Accounting and Finance records must be\\naccessed as a part of the selling process, the accounting function has a critical role to playin the sales process.\\nSupply Chain Management\\nThe functions within Supply Chain Management (SCM) include developing production\\nplans, ordering raw materials from suppliers, receiving the raw material into the facility,\\nmanufacturing products, maintaining facilities, and shipping products to customers. In our\\ncoffee shop example, Supply Chain Management functions involve making the coffee(manufacturing/production) and buying raw materials (purchasing). Production is planned\\nso that, as much as possible, coffee is available when needed, without excess that must be\\ndisposed of. This planning requires sales forecasts from the Marketing and Sales functionalarea. Sales forecasts are estimates of future product demand, which is the amount of a\\nproduct customers will want to buy. A forecast ’s accuracy will be improved if it is based on\\nhistorical sales figures (for example, factors such as cold weather or local downtown socialevents would impact the forecast for a given time period). Thus, forecasts from Marketing\\nand Sales play an important role in the production planning process.\\nProduction plans are also used to develop requirements for raw materials (coffee\\nbeans, tea bags, sweeteners, cream, and milk) and packaging (cups, stirrers, straws, plates,and napkins). You must generate raw material and packaging orders from these\\nrequirements. If the forecasts are accurate, you will not lose sales because of materialshortages, nor will you have excessive inventory that might spoil.\\nSupply Chain Management and Marketing and Sales must choose a recipe for each\\nbeverage product sold, such as the quantity of coffee beans used to brew each pot ofcoffee. The standard recipe is a key input for deciding how much to order of each raw\\nmaterial, which is a purchasing function. Access to this recipe is also necessary for\\nkeeping good manufacturing records, allowing managers within the Supply ChainManagement functional area (working with those in Accounting and Finance) to break\\ndown the costs to a per-cup cost. Managers can then compare how much it actually costs\\nto make a cup of coffee, versus how much the recipe should have cost.\\nAccounting and Finance\\nAccounting and Finance (A/F) performs financial accounting to provide summaries of\\noperational data in managerial reports, and it is also responsible for tasks such as\\ncontrolling accounts, planning and budgeting, and cash-flow management. Accounting and\\nFinance functions include recording raw data about sales transactions, raw materialpurchases, payroll, and receipt of cash from customers. Raw data are simply numbers\\ncollected from sales, manufacturing, and other operations —without any manipulation,7Business Functions and Business Processes\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Those data are then summarized in\\nmeaningful ways to determine the profitability of the coffee shop and to support\\ndecision making.\\nNote that data from Accounting and Finance are used by Marketing and Sales as well\\nas by Supply Chain Management. The sales records are an important component of thesales forecast, which is used in making staffing decisions and in production planning. The\\nrecords from accounts receivable, which you use to determine whether to grant credit to aparticular customer, are also used to monitor the overall credit-granting policy of the\\ncoffee shop. You need to be sure you have enough cash on hand to purchase raw materials,\\nas well as to finance the purchase of new equipment, such as an additional coffee machinefor the fair-trade decaffeinated coffee.\\nHuman Resources\\nEven a simple business needs employees to support the Marketing and Sales and Supply\\nChain Management functional areas, which means the business must recruit, train,\\nevaluate, and compensate employees. These are the functions of Human Resources (HR).\\nAt the coffee shop, the number of employees needed and the timing of hiring depend\\non the level of coffee and tea sales. Human Resources uses sales forecasts to planpersonnel needs. A part-time helper might be needed at forecasted peak hours or days, buthow much should a part-time helper be paid? That depends on prevailing job market\\nconditions and state laws, and it is Human Resources ’job to monitor those conditions.\\nWould increased sales justify hiring a part-time worker at the prevailing wage? Or,\\nshould you think about acquiring more automated ways of making coffee, so a personworking alone could run the shop? Resolving these questions requires input from\\nMarketing and Sales, Supply Chain Management, and Accounting and Finance.\\nThe coffee shop, while a relatively simple business, has many of the processes needed\\nin larger organizations, and these processes involve activities in more than one functionalarea. In fact, it is impossible to discuss the processes in one functional area withoutdiscussing the links to other functional areas —connections that invariably require the\\nsharing of data. Systems that are integrated using ERP software provide the data sharingthat is necessary between functional areas.\\nFUNCTIONAL AREA INFORMATION SYSTEMS\\nThis section will describe potential inputs and outputs for each functional area of abusiness (refer back to Figure 1-2 to review sample inputs and outputs related to the saleof a smartphone). Note the kinds of data needed by each area and how people use the\\ndata. Also note that the information systems maintain relationships between all functional\\nareas and processes.8Chapter 1\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In the case of Web-based systems, customer and order data are\\nstored automatically in the information system; otherwise, data must be entered manually,\\nby typing data into a computer keyboard or point-of-sale system, or by using a bar-codereader or similar device. Sales orders must be passed to Supply Chain Management for\\nplanning purposes and to Accounting and Finance for billing. Sales order data are also\\nvaluable for analyzing sales trends for business decision making. For example, Marketingand Sales management might use a report showing the trend of a product ’s sales to\\nevaluate marketing efforts and to determine strategies for the sales force.\\nMarketing and Sales also has a role in determining product prices, which requires an\\nunderstanding of the market competition and the costs of manufacturing the product.\\nPricing might be determined based on a product ’s unit cost, plus some percentage markup.\\nFor example, if a product costs $5 per unit to make, and management wants a 40 percent\\nmarkup, the selling price must be $7 per unit. Where does the per-unit cost data come\\nfrom? Determining the cost of manufacturing a product requires information from\\nAccounting and Finance, which, in turn, relies on Supply Chain Management data.\\nPeople are a valuable asset to the firm, and Marketing and Sales needs to interact with\\nHuman Resources to exchange information on hiring needs, legal requirements, and othermatters.

With accurate data about required production levels, raw material and\\npackaging can be ordered as needed, and inventory levels can be kept low, saving money.\\nOn the other hand, if data are inaccurate or not current, manufacturing may run out ofraw material or packaging; such a shortfall is called a stockout . Shortages of this type can\\nshut down production and cause the company to miss delivery dates. To avoid stockouts,management might choose to carry extra raw material and packaging, known as safety\\nstock , which can result in an overinvestment in inventory. If certain time-sensitive goods\\nare held too long, they can spoil and will have to be destroyed rather than sold for profit.The accuracy of the forecast determines the amount of safety stock required to reduce therisk of a stockout to an acceptable level. The less accurate the forecast, the more safety\\nstock is required. Accurate forecasting and production planning can reduce the need for\\nextra inventory and manufacturing capacity. In addition, Supply Chain Management canshare its planning information with the company ’s suppliers so they can plan their\\noperations more efficiently, which should allow the suppliers to reduce the price theycharge the company for their products.\\nSupply Chain Management records can provide the data needed by Accounting and\\nFinance to determine how much of each resource (materials, labor, supplies, andoverhead) was used to make completed products in inventory.\\nSupply Chain Management data can support the Marketing and Sales function by\\nproviding information about what has been produced and shipped. For example, onlineretailers such as Amazon provide detailed information on customer orders through theirWeb sites, and some send automated emails to notify customers when their orders have\\nshipped. Shipping companies, such as UPS and FedEx, provide online shipment-tracking\\ninformation. By entering a tracking number, the customer can see each step of the shippingprocess by noting where the package ’s bar code was scanned. Domino ’s Pizza allows\\ncustomers who order through their Web site to track the progress of their pizza order —\\nfrom preparation to baking to delivery. Thus, accurate and timely production informationsupports the sales process and can increase customer satisfaction. In fact, Amazon ranked\\nnumber one in the Temkin Group ’s 2011 survey of customer experience. Two of the three\\nsurvey components relate to business process: functional experience (how well the\\ncustomer was able to do what they wanted to do) and accessiblility experience (how easy it\\nwas to interact with the company). Performing well in such a survey requires a smooth\\nintegration of the Marketing and Sales and Supply Chain Management processes.\\nSupply Chain Management also interacts with Human Resources. For instance, Supply\\nChain Management passes hiring information to Human Resources, and Human Resourcesinforms Supply Chain Management of the company ’s layoff and recall policy, which might\\npertain to workers in the plant.\\nTo summarize, inputs for Supply Chain Management could include the following:\\n•Product sales data\\n•Production plans\\n•Inventory levels\\n•Layoff and recall company policy\\nOutputs for Supply Chain Management could include the following:\\n•Raw material orders\\n•Packaging orders11Business Functions and Business Processes\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

To stay efficient\\nwhile keeping customers happy and taking on more aircraft orders, the companydecided to implement an Enterprise Resource Planning system.\\nLockheed Martin ’s final system allows suppliers to handle more of their own\\ntransactions by accessing the new ERP system through an existing secure Web portal.For example, using the portal, a supplier can now track each step of an order. Inaddition, the supplier can see the production trends at Lockheed Martin, and plan itsown production to satisfy Lockheed Martin ’s needs— in effect, anticipating orders.\\nThrough this integration of many systems into one large ERP system, Lockheed Martinwas able to cut costs and connect suppliers worldwide into its system, enabling thecompany to become more efficient.\\nIn another industry, Tumi, Inc., the luggage and travel products company, was\\nrunning several legacy systems that were written “in-house, ”meaning they were\\nprogrammed by company staff. The different systems covered processes such as takingan order, running the warehouse, and completing financial statements. None of thesystems were linked; therefore, passing information from one system to another was a slowand cumbersome process. Tumi could not fill its orders on time, had excess inventory inthe warehouse, and was frequently unable to meet customers ’shipping deadlines. To\\naddress these issues —and to better support the company ’s expansion plans —Tumi made\\na conscious effort to make information technology a business driver, and the companybrought in an ERP system to integrate the business functions.\\nWith the new integrated ERP system, Tumi has been able to expand its business,\\ndecrease inventory by 30 percent, cut its warehouse space by 38 percent, and increasesales by 25 percent.

These areas of operation\\nperform the following functions:\\n•Marketing and Sales develops products, sets product prices, promotes products\\nthrough advertising and marketing, takes customer orders, supports customers, and\\ncreates sales forecasts.\\n•Supply Chain Management develops production plans, orders raw materials from\\nsuppliers, receives the raw material into the facility, manufactures products, maintains\\nfacilities, and ships products to customers.\\n•Accounting and Finance performs financial accounting to provide summaries ofoperational data in managerial reports, and also is responsible for tasks such as\\ncontrolling accounts, planning and budgeting, and cash-flow management.\\n•Human Resources recruits, hires, trains, and compensates employees, ensures\\ncompliance with government regulations, and oversees the evaluation of employees.\\n•Each functional area is served by an information system. Information systems capture,\\nprocess, and store data to provide information needed for decision making.\\n•Employees working in one functional area often need data from other functional areas. Ideally,functional area information systems are integrated, so shared data are accurate and timely.\\n•Today, business managers try to think in terms of business processes that integrate thefunctional areas, thus promoting efficiency and competitiveness.

The chapter follows this sequence:\\n•Review of the evolution of information systems and related causes for the recent\\ndevelopment of ERP systems\\n•Discussion of the few ERP software vendors that dominate the market; the current industry\\nleader, German software maker SAP AG ’s industry-leading software product, SAP ERP, is\\ndiscussed as an example of an ERP system.\\n•Review of the factors influencing a company ’s decision to purchase an ERP system\\n•Description of ERP ’s benefits\\n•Overview of frequently asked questions related to ERP systems\\n•Discussion of the future of ERP software, including the emphasis being placed on mobileapplications and accessibility of data\\nTHE EVOLUTION OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS\\nUntil recently, most companies had unintegrated information systems that supported only\\nthe activities of individual business functional areas. Thus, a company would have a\\nmarketing information system, a production information system, and so on —each with its\\nown hardware, software, and methods of processing data and information. Information\\nsystems configured in this way are known as a silos because each department has its\\nown stack, or silo, of information that is unconnected to the next silo; silos are also knownas stovepipes.\\nSuch unintegrated systems might work well within each individual functional area,\\nbut to be competitive, a company must share data among all the functional areas. When acompany ’s information systems are not integrated, costly inefficiencies can result. For\\nexample, suppose two functional areas have separate, unintegrated information systems.\\nTo share data, a clerk in one functional area needs to print out data from another\\narea and then enter the data into her area ’s information system. Not only does this data\\ninput take twice the time, it also significantly increases the chance for data entry errors.\\nAlternatively, this process might be automated by having one information system write\\ndata to a file to be read by another information system. This would reduce the probabilityof errors, but it could only be done periodically (usually overnight or on a weekend) to\\nminimize the disruption to normal business transactions. Because of the time lag in\\nupdating the system, the transferred data would rarely be up to date. In addition, datacan be defined differently in different data systems; for instance, products might be20Chapter 2\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

This variance can create\\nfurther problems in timely and accurate information sharing between functional areas.\\nIt seems obvious today that a business should have integrated software to manage all\\nfunctional areas. An integrated ERP system, however, is an incredibly complex hardwareand software system that was not feasible until the 1990s. Current ERP systems evolved\\nas a result of three things: (1) the advancement of the hardware and software technology\\n(computing power, memory, and communications) needed to support the system, (2) thedevelopment of a vision of integrated information systems, and (3) the reengineering of\\ncompanies to shift from a functional focus to a business-process focus.\\nComputer Hardware and Software Development\\nComputer hardware and software developed rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s. The first\\npractical business computers were the mainframe computers of the 1960s. Although thesecomputers began to change the way business was conducted, they were not powerful\\nenough to provide integrated, real-time data for business decision making. Over time,\\ncomputers got faster, smaller, and cheaper —leading to today ’s proliferation of mobile\\ndevices. The rapid development of computer hardware capabilities has been accurately\\ndescribed by Moore ’s Law. In 1965, Intel employee Gordon Moore observed that the\\nnumber of transistors that could be built into a computer chip doubled every 24 months.\\nThis meant that in the 1960s and 1970s the capabilities of computer hardware were\\ndoubling every 24 months, and this trend has continued, as shown in Figure 2-1.\\n100,000,0001,000,000,000\\n10,000,000Number of Transistors1,000,000\\n100,000\\n10,000\\n1,000Intel Processors\\nYear1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010400480808086802868038680486PentiumPentium IIPentium 4Itanium 2Core i7\\nSource Line: “The Evolution of a Revolution, ”ftp://download.intel.com/pressroom/kits/Intel\\nProcessorHistory.pdf ,”Intel.\\nFIGURE 2-1 The actual increase in transistors on a chip approximates Moore ’s Law21The Development of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

In the 1970s, relational database software\\nwas developed, providing businesses with the ability to store, retrieve, and analyze\\nlarge volumes of data. Spreadsheet software , a fundamental business tool today, became\\npopular in the 1980s. With spreadsheets, ma nagers could perform complex business\\nanalyses without having to rely on a computer programmer to develop customprograms.\\nThe computer hardware and software developments of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s\\npaved the way for the development of ERP systems.\\nEarly Attempts to Share Resources\\nAs PCs gained popularity in business in the 1980s, it became clear that users needed away to share peripheral equipment (such as printers and hard disks, which were fairlyexpensive in the early 1980s) and, more importantly, data. At that point, important\\nbusiness information was being stored on individual PCs, but there was no easy way to\\nshare the information electronically.\\nBy the mid-1980s, telecommunications developments allowed users to share data and\\nperipherals on local networks. Usually, these networks were groups of computersconnected to one another within a single physical location. This meant that workers coulddownload data from a central computer to their desktop PCs and work with the data at\\ntheir desks.\\nThis central computer –local computer arrangement is now called a client-server\\narchitecture. Servers (central computers) became more powerful and less expensivea n dp r o v i d e ds c a l a b i l i t y . Scalability means that the capacity of a piece of equipment\\ncan be increased by adding new hardware. In the case of a client-server network, the\\nability to add servers makes the network scalable —thus extending the life of the\\nhardware investment. Scalability is a characteristic of client-server networks, butusually not of mainframe-based systems.\\nBy the end of the 1980s, much of the hardware and software needed to support the\\ndevelopment of ERP systems was in place: fast computers, networked access, andadvanced database technology. Recall from Chapter 1 that ERP programs helporganizations manage company-wide business processes using a common database, which\\nholds a very large amount of data. The software that holds that data in an organized\\nfashion, and that allows for the easy retrieval of data, is the database management system\\n(DBMS) . By the mid-1980s, the DBMS required to manage the development of complex\\nERP software existed. The final element required for the development of ERP software wasunderstanding and acceptance from the business community. Many businesspeople didnot yet recognize the benefits of integrated information systems nor were they willing to\\ncommit the resources to develop ERP software.\\nThe Manufacturing Roots of ERP\\nThe concept of an integrated informatio n system took shape on the factory floor.\\nManufacturing software advanced during t he 1960s and 1970s, evolving from simple22Chapter 2\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

MRP is\\na production-scheduling methodology that determines the timing and quantity of\\nproduction runs and purchase-order releases to meet a master production schedule.\\nMRP software allowed a plant manager to plan production and raw materialsrequirements by working backward from the sales forecast, the prediction of future\\nsales. The plant manager first looked at Marketing and Sales ’forecast of customer\\ndemand, then looked at the production schedule needed to meet that demand,\\ncalculated the raw materials needed to meet the required production levels, and finally,\\nprojected the cost of those raw materials. For a company with many products, raw\\nmaterials, and shared production resources, this kind of projection was impossiblewithout a computer to keep track of various inputs.\\nThe basic functions of MRP could be handled by mainframe computers; however, the\\nadvent of electronic data interchange (EDI) —the direct computer-to-computer exchange\\nof standard business documents —allowed companies to handle the purchasing process\\nelectronically, avoiding the cost and delays resulting from paper purchase order andinvoice systems. The functional area now known as Supply Chain Management (SCM)began with the sharing of long-range production schedules between manufacturers and\\ntheir suppliers.\\nManagement ’s Impetus to Adopt ERP\\nThe hard economic times of the late 1980s and early 1990s caused many companies to\\ndownsize and reorganize. These company overhauls were one stimulus for ERPdevelopment. Companies needed to find some way to avoid the following kind of situation\\n(which they had tolerated for a long time):\\nImagine you are the CEO of Mountaineering, Inc., an outdoor outfitter catering to the\\nyoung and trendy sportsperson. Mountaineering, Inc. is profitable and keeping pace\\nwith the competition, but the company ’s information systems are unintegrated and\\ninefficient (as are the systems of your competitors). The Marketing and Sales\\nDepartment creates a time-consuming and unwieldy paper trail when negotiating and\\nclosing sales with retailers. To schedule factory production, however, the manager of\\nthe Manufacturing Department needs accurate, timely information about actual andprojected sales orders from the Marketing and Sales manager. Without such\\ninformation, the Manufacturing manager must make a guess about which products\\nto produce —and how many —in order to keep goods moving through the production\\nline. Sometimes a guess overestimates demand, and sometimes it underestimates\\ndemand.\\nOverproduction of a certain product might mean your company is stuck with a\\nproduct for which there is a diminishing market due to style changes or changes inseasonal demand. When your company stores product —such as hiking boots —as it\\nwaits for a buyer, you incur warehouse expense. On the other hand,\\nunderproduction of a certain style of boot might result in product not being ready\\nfor a promised delivery date, leading to unhappy customers and, possibly, canceled\\norders. If you try to catch up on orders, you ’ll have to pay factory workers overtime\\nor resort to the extra expense of rapid-delivery shipments.23The Development of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

The computer industry of the time was quite different from\\nthat of today. IBM controlled the computer market with its 360 mainframe computer,\\nwhich had only 512K of main memory. In this mainframe computer environment, the SAP\\nfounders recognized that all companies developing computer software faced the samebasic business problems, and each developed unique, but similar, solutions for their needs\\nin payroll processing, accounting, materials management, and other functional areas of\\nbusiness. SAP ’s goal was to develop a standard software product that could be configured\\nto meet the needs of each company. According to founder Dietmar Hopp, SAP ’s concept\\nfrom the beginning was to set standards in information technology. In addition, thefounders wanted data available in real time, and they wanted users to work on a computerscreen rather than with voluminous printed output. These goals were lofty and forward-\\nlooking for 1972, and it took almost 20 years to achieve them.\\nSAP Begins Developing Software Modules\\nBefore leaving IBM, Plattner and Hopp had worked on an order-processing system for the\\nGerman chemical company ICI. The order-processing system was so successful that ICImanagers also wanted a materials and logistics management system —a system for\\nhandling the purchase, receiving, and storage of materials —that could be integrated into\\nthe new order-processing system. In the course of their work for ICI, Plattner and Hopphad already developed the idea of modular software development. Software modules are\\nindividual programs that can be purchased, installed, and run separately, but all of themodules extract data from a common database.\\nIn the course of their work together, Plattner and Hopp began to consider the idea of\\nleaving IBM to form their own company so they would be free to pursue their ownapproach to software development. They also asked Claus Wellenreuther, an expert infinancial accounting who had just left IBM, to join them, and on April 1, 1972, SAP was\\nfounded. At the time Plattner, Hopp, and Wellenreuther established the company, they\\ncould not even afford to purchase their own computer. Their first contract, with ICI, todevelop the follow-on materials and logistics management system, included access to ICI ’s\\nmainframe computer at night —a practice they repeated with other clients until they\\nacquired their first computer in 1980. At ICI, the SAP founders developed their firstsoftware package, variously called System R, System RF (for real-time financial\\naccounting), and R/1.\\nTo keep up with the ongoing development of mainframe computer technology, in 1978\\nSAP began developing a more integrated version of its software products, called the R/2system. In 1982, after four years of development, SAP released its R/2 mainframe ERP\\nsoftware package.\\nSales grew rapidly in the 1980s, and SAP extended its software ’s capabilities and\\nexpanded into international markets. This was no small task, because the software had to beable to accommodate different languages, currencies, accounting practices, and tax laws.\\nBy 1988, SAP had established subsidiaries in numerous foreign countries, launched a\\njoint venture with consulting company Arthur Andersen, and sold its 1,000th system. SAPalso became SAP AG, a publicly traded company.\\nSAP R/3\\nIn 1988, SAP realized the potential of client-server hardware architecture and begandevelopment of its R/3system to take advantage of client-server technology.

Each subsequent release of the SAP R/3 software\\ncontained new features and capabilities. The client-server architecture used by SAP\\nallowed R/3 to run on a variety of computer platforms, including UNIX and Windows NT.\\nThe SAP R/3 system was also designed using an open architecture approach. In open\\narchitecture , third-party software companies are encouraged to develop add-on software\\nproducts that can be integrated with existing software. The open architecture also makesit easy for companies to integrate their hardware products, such as bar-code scanners,personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, and global information systems with the\\nSAP system.\\nNew Directions in ERP\\nIn the late 1990s, the year 2000, or Y2K, problem motivated many companies to move to\\nERP systems. As it became clear that the date turnover from December 31, 1999, toJanuary 1, 2000, could wreak havoc on some information systems, companies searched for\\nways to consolidate data, and ERP systems provided one solution.\\nThe Y2K problem originated from programming shortcuts made by programmers in\\nthe preceding decades. With memory and storage space a small fraction of what it is today,early programmers developed software that used as few computer resources as possible.\\nTo save memory, programmers in the 1970s and 1980s typically wrote programs that onlyused two digits to identify a year. For example, if an invoice was posted on October 29,\\n1975, the programmer could just store the date as 10/29/75, rather than 10/29/1975. While\\nthis may not seem like a big storage savings, for companies with millions of transactionsthat needed to be stored and manipulated, it added up. These programmers never\\nimagined that software written in the 1970s would still be running major companies and\\nfinancial institutions in 1999. These old systems were known as legacy systems . Many\\ncompanies were faced with a choice: pay programmers millions of dollars to correct the\\nY2K problem in their old, already outdated software —or invest in an ERP system that\\nwould not only solve the Y2K problem, but potentially provide better management of\\ntheir business processes as well. Thus, the Y2K problem led to a dramatic increase in\\nbusiness for ERP vendors in the late 1990s. However, the rapid growth of the 1990s was\\nfollowed by an ERP slump starting in 1999. By 1999, many companies were in the finalstages of either an ERP implementation or modification of their existing software. Many\\ncompanies that had not yet decided to move to a Y2K-compliant ERP system waited until\\nafter the new millennium to upgrade their information systems.\\nBy 2000, SAP AG had 22,000 employees in 50 countries and 10 million users at\\n30,000 installations around the world. By that time, SAP also had competition in the ERPmarket, namely from Oracle and PeopleSoft.\\nPeopleSoft\\nPeopleSoft was founded by David Duffield, a former IBM employee who, like SAP ’s\\nfounders, faced opposition to his ideas from IBM management. PeopleSoft started out\\noffering software for human resources and payroll accounting, and it achieved\\nconsiderable success, even with companies that already were using SAP for accounting\\nand production. In fact, PeopleSoft ’s success caused SAP to make significant modifications\\nto its Human Resources module. In 2003, PeopleSoft strengthened its offerings in the\\nsupply chain area with its acquisition of ERP software vendor JD Edwards. Then, in late\\n2004, Oracle succeeded in its bid to take over PeopleSoft. Today, PeopleSoft, under27The Development of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Oracle began in 1977 as Software Development\\nLaboratories (SDL). Its founders, Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates, won a contract\\nfrom the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to develop a system, called Oracle, to manage\\nlarge volumes of data and extract information quickly. Although the Oracle project was\\ncanceled before a successful product was developed, the three founders of SDL saw thecommercial potential of a relational database system. In 1979, SDL became Relational\\nSoftware, Inc., and released its first commercial database product. The company changed\\nits name again, to Oracle, and in 1986 released the client-server Oracle relationaldatabase. The company continued to improve its database product, and in 1988 released\\nOracle Financials, a set of financial applications. The financial applications suite of\\nmodules included Oracle Financials, Oracle Supply Chain Management, OracleManufacturing, Oracle Project Systems, Oracle Human Resources, and Oracle Market\\nManagement. Oracle Financials was the foundation for what would become Oracle ’s ERP\\nproduct.\\nMuch of Oracle ’s recent growth in ERP applications has been through acquisition. In\\naddition to PeopleSoft and JD Edwards, in 2005 Oracle acquired Siebel, a major customer\\nrelationship management (CRM) software company. (CRM is discussed in more detail inChapter 3.) In 2010, Oracle completed its acquisition of Sun Microsystems, a major\\nmanufacturer of computer hardware and software that developed the Java software\\ndevelopment platform. According to Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, with this latest acquisition,“Oracle will be the only company that can engineer an integrated system —applications to\\ndisk—where all the pieces fit and work together so customers do not have to do it\\nthemselves. Our customers benefit as their systems integration costs go down whilesystem performance, reliability, and security go up. ”\\nIn 2010, in an effort to consolidate its customer base on a single software platform,\\nOracle released Fusion Applications, which is a software suite designed to give itsPeopleSoft, JD Edwards, and Siebel customers a modular and flexible upgrade path to a\\nsingle Oracle ERP solution.\\nThe concepts of an Enterprise Resource Planning system are similar for the large ERP\\nvendors, such as SAP and Oracle, and for the many smaller vendors of ERP software.Because of SAP ’s leadership in the ERP industry, this textbook focuses primarily on SAP ’s\\nERP software products as an example of an Enterprise Resource Planning system.

In information systems, errors most frequently occur where\\nhuman beings interact with the system. ERP systems ensure that data are entered only once,\\nwhere they are most likely to be accurate. For example, with access to real-time stock data, a\\nsalesperson taking an order can confirm the availability of the desired material. When thesalesperson enters the sales order into the system, the order data are immediately available to\\nSupply Chain Management, so Manufacturing can update production plans, and Materials\\nManagement can plan the delivery of the order. If the sales order data are entered correctlyby the salesperson, then Supply Chain Management personnel are working with the same,\\ncorrect data. The same sales data are also available to Accounting for invoice preparation.\\nEarlier in this chapter, you learned how software modules work. Figure 2-5 shows the\\nmajor functional modules in the current SAP ERP system, also known as SAP ECC 6.0(Enterprise Central Component 6.0), and depicts how the modules provide integration.\\nThe basic functions of each of the modules are as follows:\\n•TheSales and Distribution (SD) module records sales orders and scheduled\\ndeliveries. Information about the customer (pricing, address and shipping\\ninstructions, billing details, and so on) is maintained and accessed from thismodule.\\n•TheMaterials Management (MM) module manages the acquisition of raw\\nmaterials from suppliers (purchasing) and the subsequent handling of rawmaterials inventory, from storage to work-in-progress goods to shipping offinished goods to the customer.\\n•TheProduction Planning (PP) module maintains production information.\\nHere production is planned and scheduled, and actual production activities arerecorded.Human\\nResourcesMarketing\\nand Sales\\nAccounting\\nand FinanceSupply Chain\\nManagementCentral data\\nSource Line: Course Technology/Cengage Learning.\\nFIGURE 2-4 Data flow within an integrated information system29The Development of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

The CO module\\nsupports managerial decision making.\\nTheWorkflow (WF) module is not a module that automates a specific business\\nfunction. Rather, it is a set of tools that can be used to automate any of the activities in\\nSAP ERP. It can perform task-flow analysis and prompt employees (by email) if they need\\nto take action. The Workflow module works well for business processes that are not daily\\nactivities but that occur frequently enough to be worth the effort to implement theworkflow module— such as preparing customer invoices.\\nIn summary, ERP integrates business functional areas with one another. Before\\nERP, each functional area operated independently, using its own information systemsand methods for recording transactions. ERP software also makes management\\nreporting and decision making faster and more uniform throughout an organization. In\\naddition, ERP promotes thinking about corpo rate goals, as opposed to focusing only on\\nthe goals of a single department or functional area. When top management is queried\\non the reasons for implementing ERP systems, the overriding answer is control .W i t h\\nthe capability to see integrated data on their entire company ’s operation, managers\\nuse ERP systems for the control they provide, allowing managers to set corporate goals\\ncorrectly.\\nSAP ERP Software Implementation\\nA truly integrated information system requires integrating all functional areas, but for\\nvarious reasons, not all companies that adopt SAP software use all of the SAP ERPmodules. For example, a company without factories wouldn ’t select the manufacturing-\\nrelated modules. Another company might consider its Human Resources Department ’s\\noperations to be so separate from its other operations that it would decide not integrateits Human Resources functional area. And another company might believe that its\\ninternally developed production and logistics software gives it a competitive advantage.\\nSo it might implement the SAP ERP Financial Accounting and Human Resourcesmodules, and then integrate its internally deve loped production and lo gistics system into\\nthe SAP ERP system.\\nGenerally, a company ’s level of data integration is highest when the company uses\\none vendor to supply all its ERP modules. When a company uses modules from\\ndifferent vendors, additional software must be created to get the modules to work\\ntogether. Frequently, companies integrate different systems using batch data transfer\\nprocesses that are performed periodically. In those cases, however, the company no\\nlonger has accurate data available in real time across the enterprise. Thus, a company\\nmust be sure the decision to use multiple vendors —or to maintain a legacy system —is\\nbased on sound business analysis, not on a resistance to change. Software upgrades of\\nnonintegrated systems are made more problematic because further work must be\\ndone to get software from different vendors to interact. SAP ’s NetWeaver development\\nplatform (discussed in Chapter 8) eases the integration of SAP ERP with other\\nsoftware products.31The Development of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

There are countless examples of large implementations failing, and it is easy\\nto understand why. Many different departments are involved, as are the many users of the\\nsystem, programmers, systems analysts, and other personnel. Without top managementcommitment, large projects are doomed to fail. More implementation issues are discussed\\nin Chapter 7.\\nAfter a company chooses its major modules, it must make an incredible number of\\ndecisions on how to configure the system. These configuration options allow the companyto customize the modules it has chosen to fit its needs. For example, in the Financial\\nAccounting (FI) module, a business might need to define limits on the dollar value ofbusiness transactions that certain employees can process. This is an important\\nconsideration in minimizing the risk of fraud and abuse, and is just one example of the\\nmany decisions facing a company at the start of a major ERP implementation.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nTolerance Groups\\nIn configuring the SAP system, a company can define tolerance groups , which are\\nspecific ranges that define transaction limits. An example of a tolerance group is shown\\nin Figure 2-6. As part of the configuration process, a company can define any numberof tolerance groups with a range of limits, and can then assign employees to thesetolerance groups.\\nSource Line: SAP AG.\\nFIGURE 2-6 A customization example: tolerance groups to set transaction limits\\n(continued)32Chapter 2\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Assume a sporting goods company places an order in\\nJanuary for 1,000 life jackets. The company receives only 995 in the shipment from themanufacturer, which arrives in March. This delivery, although it is short five life jackets,is close enough to the original order that it is accepted as complete. The difference ofthe five life jackets represents the tolerance. By defining the tolerance group to accept avariance of a small percentage of the shipment, the company has determined that it isnot worth pursuing the five extra life jackets. Tolerance could indicate a shortage, as inthis example, or an overabundance in an order. Thus, an order of 1,005 life jacketswould also be within the tolerance. Tolerance groups should be defined and documented,in part to deal with fraud issues. The sporting goods company should know the reasonfor a short order: is it because the order is within the tolerance range, or is it becausea worker on the loading dock stole five life jackets?\\nQuestion:\\n1. Can you think of other areas within a company that would need to have some\\nlimits set on variances or payments? Why would it be beneficial to set thosetolerance groups?\\nFeatures of SAP ERP\\nNot only was SAP ERP the first software to deliver real-time ERP integration, it has other\\nfeatures worthy of note. Its most significant characteristics are its suitability for large\\ncompanies, high cost, automation of data updates, and applicability of best practices —all\\nof which are described below.\\nThe original SAP ERP system targeted very large companies. Prior to the development\\nof ERP systems, it was assumed that these giants could never have integrated systems\\nbecause of the sheer amount of computing power required to integrate them. Increasedcomputing speeds, however, meant that large companies in a variety of industries,\\nincluding manufacturing, gas and oil, airlines, and consulting, could have integrated\\ninformation systems.\\nAcquiring an SAP ERP software system is very expensive. In addition to the cost of the\\nsoftware, many companies find they must buy new hardware to accommodate suchpowerful programs. For a Fortune 500 company, software, hardware, and consulting\\ncosts can easily exceed $100 million. Large companies can also spend $50 million to\\n$100 million when it is time to upgrade to a newer version of their ERP software. Full\\nimplementation of all modules can take years. In fact, most companies view ERPimplementations as an ongoing process, not a one-off project. As implementations are\\ncompleted in one area of a company, other areas may begin an implementation or upgrade\\na previous implementation.\\nThe modular design of SAP ERP is based on business processes, such as sales order\\nhandling, materials requirement handling, and employee recruiting. When data areentered into the system, data in all related files in the central database are automaticallyupdated. No further human input is required to make the changes.\\nBefore the development of SAP ERP, companies often sought vendors to write software to\\nfit their business processes. As SAP accumulated experience developing information systems,33The Development of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Thus, SAP ERP ’s design incorporates best practices for a wide variety of\\nprocesses. A best practice is the best, most efficient way of handling a certain business\\nprocess. If a company ’s business practices do not follow one of the best practices incorporated\\nin the SAP ERP design, then the business must redesign its practices so it can use the\\nsoftware. Although some customization is possible during implementation, many companies\\nfind they must still change some of the ways they work to fit the software.\\nERP FOR MIDSIZED AND SMALLER COMPANIES\\nBy 1998, most of the Fortune 500 companies had already installed ERP systems, so ERP\\nvendors refocused their marketing efforts on midsized companies (those with fewer than1,000 employees). Small and midsized companies represented a ripe, profitable market.\\nFor example, in 2001, small and midsized companies in the United States increased their\\nIT expenditure by more than 4 percent over the previous year. To appeal to this newmarket, SAP developed SAP Business All-in-One, a single package containing specific,\\npreconfigured bundles of SAP ERP tailored for particular industries, such as automotive,\\nbanking, chemicals, and oil and gas. Because it is tailored to specific industries, SAPBusiness All-in-One can be installed more quickly than the standard ERP product.\\nTo address the needs of smaller companies, such as those with less than 500\\nemployees, SAP purchased the ERP system of Israeli-based TopManage Financial Systems in2002, and renamed this package SAP Business One. The capabilities of SAP Business One\\nhave increased over the years through both internal development at SAP and the\\nacquisition of other software companies such as iLytix Systems AS, which added newreporting capabilities to SAP Business One. In July 2011, SAP announced that SAP Business\\nOne would be available in a new subscription-based, hosted offering through SAP partners.\\nIn addition, SAP has developed its BusinessByDesign product, which is an ERP\\nproduct hosted by SAP and accessed through a Web browser. It is an example of thesoftware-as-a-service (SaaS) approach that eliminates the need for a company to buy and\\nmaintain the software and hardware to run an ERP application. SaaS does not eliminatethe need to configure the software to manage a company ’s processes or the need to train\\nusers of the system, but it does reduce the need for IT support staff to operate the ERPsystem. SaaS is discussed more fully in Chapter 8.\\nSAP and Oracle have significant competition for small-business customers from a\\nnumber of smaller ERP software companies such as Sage Business Solutions, Exact, Infor,and Epicor. In 2000, software giant Microsoft acquired Great Plains, a provider of ERPsoftware, as an entry into the small-business ERP market. Microsoft currently has five ERP\\nproducts offered under the Microsoft Dynamics label.\\nResponses of the Software to the Changing Market\\nIn the mid-1990s, many companies complained about the difficulty of implementing the\\nSAP R/3 system. SAP faced a canceled implementation by Dell Computers, a lengthyimplementation at Owens Corning, and a lawsuit by the now-defunct FoxMeyer drug\\ncompany. Cadbury experienced a well-publicized surplus of chocolate bars at the end of\\n2005, due, in part, to a troubled SAP ERP implementation. In response to these and otherimplementation challenges, SAP developed the Accelerated SAP (ASAP) implementation34Chapter 2\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In many cases, these products prov ide more flexible and powerful versions of\\ntools available in the SAP ERP system. SAP ’s Business Warehouse (BW) product is an\\nexample of one such solution. Customers needing more capability and flexibility toanalyze data beyond the standard tools and reports in the SD, PP, and FI modules can\\nadd Business Warehouse (BW). The BW software runs on a separate server and lets the\\nuser define unique reporting and analysis methods and integrate information from\\nother systems.\\nThe tools used to analyze data in the BW system are known as business intelligence (BI).\\nAs an example of the use of the business intelligence that can be gained through usingSAP’s Business Warehouse module, SAP has recently announced its in-memory data\\nanalysis tool, SAP HANA (High-performance ANalytical Appliance), a technology which\\nwill likely revolutionize Business Intelligence. Rather than storing data on hard disk drives,\\nSAP’s HANA system stores data in memory for dramatically quicker access. SAP HANA\\nwill allow companies to analyze business operations and large volumes of transactional and\\nanalytical data in real time.\\nThe SAP ERP system provides some tools to manage customer interactions and\\nanalyze the success of promotional campaigns, but SAP also sells a separate applicationcalled Customer Relationship Management (CRM), which has extended customer service\\ncapabilities. SAP ’s CRM product is designed to compete with CRM systems from\\ncompetitors, such as Oracle ’s Siebel CRM application.\\nSAP addressed the issue of Internet-based data exchange with its NetWeaver\\nintegration platform, which provides a unified means to connect SAP systems to other\\nsystems and to the Internet.\\nLike all technology, ERP software and related products are constantly changing. Thus,\\nthe challenge for a company is not only to evaluate an ERP vendor ’s current product\\nofferings, but also to assess its development strategies and product plans.\\nCHOOSING CONSULTANTS AND VENDORS\\nBecause ERP software packages are so large and complex, one person cannot fullyunderstand a single ERP system; it is also impossible for an individual to adequatelycompare various systems. So, before choosing a software vendor, most companies study\\ntheir needs and then hire an external team of software consultants to help choose the\\nright software vendor(s) and the best approach to implementing ERP. Working as a teamwith the customer, the consultants apply their expertise to selecting an ERP vendor\\n(or vendors) that will best meet their customer ’s needs.\\nAfter recommending a vendor, the consultants will typically recommend the software\\nmodules best suited to the company ’s operations, along with the configurations within\\nthose modules that are most appropriate. This preplanning should involve not only the\\nconsultants and a company ’s IT department, but the management of all functional\\nbusiness areas as well.35The Development of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Recall that integrated information\\nsystems can lead to more efficient business processes that cost less than those in\\nunintegrated systems. In addition, ERP systems offer the following benefits:\\n•ERP allows easier global integration. Barriers of currency exchange rates,\\nlanguage, and culture can be bridged automatically, so data can be integrated\\nacross international borders.\\n•ERP integrates people and data while eliminating the need to update and\\nrepair many separate computer systems. For example, at one point, Boeing\\nhad 450 data systems that fed data into its production process; the companynow has a single system for recording production data.\\n•ERP allows management to actually manage operations, not just monitorthem. For example, without ERP, getting an answer to “How are we doing?”\\nrequires getting data from each business unit and then analyzing that data for\\na comprehensive, integrated picture. The ERP system already has all the\\ndata, allowing the manager to focus on improving processes. This focusenhances management of the company as a whole, and makes the\\norganization more adaptable when change is required.\\nAn ERP system can dramatically reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. For\\nexample, EZ-FLO International, Inc., a family-run plumbing products manufacturer and\\ndistributor, had been experiencing double-digit growth and needed a scalable businessplatform to support its global growth. The company selected SAP Business All-in-One\\ncustomized for wholesale distribution. As a result of the integrated process capabilities,\\nEZ-FLO has been able to greatly improve its inventory management processes and haseliminated its annual inventory count, which used to take 100 employees two days to complete.\\nIn addition, the company has reduced manufacturing lead times in its domestic plants by two\\nweeks. These process improvements led to improved customer service, and a 20 percentincrease in the number of new customers —with a 12 percent growth in sales per customer.\\nWelch Foods, Inc., is the processing and marketing subsidiary of the National Grape\\nCooperative, an organization of 1,200 U.S. and Canadian grape growers. In 2004, Welch ’s\\ndecided to implement Oracle ’s E-Business Suite to make better decisions regarding product\\nmix, production, and marketing. For Welch ’s, a key advantage of the ERP system is that it\\nprovides a “single source of truth ”on production costs and on customer and product\\nprofitability, allowing Welch ’s management team to make better business decisions.\\nQUESTIONS ABOUT ERP\\nHow Much Does an ERP System Cost?\\nThe total cost of an ERP system implementation includes several factors, including the\\nfollowing:\\n•The scale of the ERP software, which corresponds to the size of the company\\nit serves\\n•The need for new hardware capable of running complex ERP software\\n•Consultants ’and analysts ’fees36Chapter 2\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Such an installation might cost as much as $30\\nmillion in software license fees, $200 million in consulting fees, additional millions to\\npurchase new hardware, and even more millions to train managers and employees —and\\nfull implementation of the new system could take four to six years.\\nA midsized company (one with fewer than 1,000 employees) might spend $10 million\\nto $20 million in total implementation costs and have its ERP system up and running inabout two years.\\nA smaller company, one with less than $50 million in annual revenue, could expect to\\npay about $300,000 for an ERP implementation, and one with revenue of $100– 250 million\\ncould spend around $1.4 million. For these smaller companies, implementations usually\\ntake about 10 months.\\nShould Every Business Buy an ERP Package?\\nERP packages imply, by their design, a certain way of doing business, and they require\\nusers to follow that way of doing business. For a particular business, some of itsoperations —or certain segments of its operations —might not be a good match with the\\nconstraints inherent in ERP. Therefore, it is imperative for a business to analyze its ownbusiness strategy, organization, culture, and operation before choosing an ERP approach.\\nA 1998 article in the Harvard Business Review provides examples that show the\\nvalue of planning before trying to implement an ERP system: “Applied Materials gave up\\non its system when it found itself overwhelmed by the organization changes involved. DowChemical spent seven years and close to half a billion dollars implementing a mainframe-\\nbased enterprise system; now it has decided to start over again on a client-server version.”\\nIn another example, Kmart in 2002 wrote off $130 million because of a failed ERP supplychain project. At the time, Kmart was not happy with its existing supply chain software,\\nand it attempted to implement another product too quickly.\\nFor years, the giant U.S. retailer Walmart chose not to purchase an ERP system, but\\nrather to write all its software in-house. Walmart’ s philosophy was that the global strategic\\nbusiness process should drive the technology. The company ’s IT personnel were\\nencouraged to consider the merchandising aspect of a process first and foremost, and then\\nlet the technology follow. However, in 2007, Walmart changed its course and decided to\\nimplement SAP Financials. The CIO of Walmart is reported to have said that\\nimplementing SAP ’s financial package would enable the company to grow in many\\ncountries, including China.\\nERP systems are popping up in some unlikely industries. The government of Singapore is\\nimplementing an ERP project that will link 20 different healthcare providers together underone system, which is estimated to be 20 percent more efficient and will eliminate a\\ntremendous amount of duplicate information. Along with the normal modules that an ERP\\nsystem contains, such as financials and human resource management, this enterprisehealthcare system will include electronic medical records and clinical management modules.\\nSometimes, a company is not ready for ERP.

If a company\\nis not prepared to change its business processes to make them more efficient, then it will\\nfind itself with a large bill for software and consulting fees, with no improvement in\\norganizational performance.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nSustainability and ERP\\nERP systems are helping companies track their energy consumption. SAP and Walmart\\nare not only teaming up for the implementation of the retail giant ’s financial software,\\nbut they are also promoting a unified front on sustainability —focusing on reducing\\npollution while increasing profits —through the use of ERP software. Many SAP\\ncustomers have cut energy usage; for example, 7-Eleven reduced its cooling energy usageby 12 percent, Dannon cut its fuel costs by 22 percent with better management of itstransportation system, and Kendall-Jackson wine makers cut their lighting bill by40 percent —all through the use of enhanced information from their ERP system.\\nCompanies can use the software to track and report on their energy consumption;\\nhowever, in order to make changes, a company must determine the baseline of its energy\\nconsumption. For instance, Walmart was surprised to find that only 8 percent of its carbon\\nfootprint was under the direct control of the company, the remaining 92 percent was in thecompany ’s supply chain. Since 85 percent of Walmart ’s suppliers run SAP, Walmart saw an\\nopportunity to encourage energy savings on the part of the companies that supply theWalmart stores. SAP sustainability software application allows Walmart and its suppliers totrack their energy usage, emissions, and consumption of other natural resources.\\nQuestion:\\n1. How important is sustainability to a company ’s bottom line? How about it\\nits image?\\nIs ERP Software Inflexible?\\nAlthough many people claim that ERP systems (especially the SAP ERP system) are\\nrigid, SAP ERP does offer numerous configuration options that help businesses customize\\nt h es o f t w a r et of i tt h e i ru n i q u en e e d s .I na ddition, programmers can write specific\\nroutines for special applications in SAP ’s internal programming language, called\\nAdvanced Business Application Programming (ABAP) . The integration platform,\\nNetWeaver, offers further flexibility in adding both SAP and non-SAP components to acompany’ s IT infrastructure. Companies need to be careful about how much custom\\nprogramming they include in their implementations, or they could find they have simplyre-created their existing information systems in a new software package instead ofgaining the benefits of improved, integrated business processes. In its implementation of\\nPeopleSoft, FedEx Corporation installed the systems for Financial and Human Resources\\nfunctions with little or no modification.\\nOnce an ERP system is in place, trying to reconfigure it while retaining data integrity\\nis expensive and time consuming.

It is much easier to customize an ERP program during system configuration,\\nbefore any data have been stored.\\nWhat Return Can a Company Expect from Its ERP Investment?\\nThe financial benefits provided by an ERP system can be difficult to calculate because\\nsometimes ERP increases revenue and decreases expenses in ways that are difficult to\\nmeasure. In addition, some changes take place over such a long period of time that they aredifficult to track. Finally, the old information system may not be able to provide good data on\\nthe performance of the company before the ERP implementation, making comparison difficult.\\nStill, the return on an ERP investment can be measured and interpreted in many ways:\\n•Because ERP eliminates redundant effort and duplicated data, it can\\ngenerate savings in operations expense. And because an ERP system canhelp a company produce goods and services more quickly, more sales can begenerated every month.\\n•In some instances, a company that does not implement an ERP system mightbe forced out of business by competitors that have an ERP system —how do\\nyou calculate the monetary advantage of remaining in business?\\n•A smoothly running ERP system can save a company ’s personnel, suppliers,\\ndistributors, and customers much frustration —a benefit that is real, but\\ndifficult to quantify.\\n•Because both cost savings and increased revenue occur over many years, it isdifficult to put an exact dollar figure to the amount accrued from the originalERP investment.\\n•Because ERP implementations take time, there may be other business factorsaffecting the company ’s costs and profitability, making it difficult to isolate\\nthe impact of the ERP system alone.\\n•ERP systems provide real-time data, allowing companies to improve externalcustomer communications, which can improve customer relationships andincrease sales.\\nHow Long Does It Take to See a Return on an ERP Investment?\\nAreturn on investment (ROI) is an assessment of an investment project ’s value, calculated by\\ndividing the value of the project ’s benefits by the project ’s costs. An ERP system ’s ROI can be\\ndifficult to calculate because of the many intangible costs and benefits previously mentioned.\\nSome companies do not even try to make the calculation, on the grounds that the package is\\nas necessary as having electricity (which is not justified as an investment project). Companies\\nthat do make the ROI calculation have seen widely varying results. Some ERP consultingfirms refuse to do ERP implementations unless their client company performs an ROI.\\nPeerstone Research reported on over 200 companies using SAP or Oracle ERP systems and\\nfound that 38 percent of survey respondents do not perform formal ROI evaluations.\\nIn the Peerstone Research study, 63 percent of companies that did perform the\\ncalculation reported a positive ROI for ERP. Manufacturing firms are more likely to see apositive ROI than government or educational organizations. However, most companiesreported that nonfinancial goals were the primary motivation for their ERP installations.\\nSeventy-one percent of those companies surveyed said that the goal behind the ERP\\ninstallation was improved management vision. Although Nestlé USA had problems with itsERP implementation, it estimated a cost savings of $325 million, after spending six years\\nand over $200 million on the implementation.39The Development of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

With this larger pool of customers, Toro ’s ERP\\nsystem allowed it to save $10 million in inventory costs annually —the result of better\\nproduction, warehousing, and distribution methods.\\nA recent survey of small and midsized companies showed that only 48 percent\\nalways do an ROI evaluation, and only 25 percent always repeat the calculation after\\nimplementation. These small and midsized business owners feel they just need an ERP to\\nsupport their business, even if the ROI calculation is not performed.\\nWhy Do Some Companies Have More Success with ERP Than Others?\\nEarly ERP implementation reports indicated that only a small percentage ofcompanies experienced a smooth rollout of their new ERP systems and immediately\\nbegan receiving the benefits they anticipated. However, it is important to put suchreports into perspective. Allkinds of software implementations can suffer from delays,\\ncost overruns, and performance problems —not just ERP projects. Such delays have\\nbeen a major problem for the IS industry since the early days of business computing.Nevertheless, it is worth thinking specifically about why ERP installation problemscan occur.\\nYou can find numerous cases of implementation woes in the news. W. L. Gore, the\\nmaker of GoreTex fabric, had problems implementing its PeopleSoft system for personnel,payroll, and benefits. The manufacturer sued PeopleSoft, Deloitte & Touche LLP, and\\nDeloitte Consulting for incompetence. W. L. Gore blamed the consultants for not\\nunderstanding the system and leaving its Personnel department in a mess. PeopleSoftconsultants were brought in to resolve the problems after implementation, but the fix cost\\nW. L. Gore additional hundreds of thousands of dollars.\\nHershey Foods (now The Hershey Company) had a rough rollout of its ERP system in\\n1999, due to its use of what experts call the “Big Bang” approach to implementation, in\\nwhich huge pieces of the system are implemented all at once. Companies rarely use this\\napproach because it is so risky. Hershey ’s order-processing and shipping departments had\\nglitches that were being fixed as late as September. Because of that, Hershey lost a large\\nshare of the Halloween candy market that year.\\nUsually, a bumpy rollout and low ROI are caused by people problems and misguided\\nexpectations, not computer malfunctions:\\n•Some executives blindly hope that new software will cure fundamental\\nbusiness problems that are not curable by any software. The root of aproblem may lie in flawed core business processes. Unless the companychanges its business processes, it will just be computerizing an ineffectiveway of doing business.\\n•Some executives and IT managers don ’tt a k ee n o u g ht i m ef o rap r o p e r\\nanalysis during the planning and implementation phase.\\n•Some executives and IT managers skimp on employee education and training.\\n•Some companies do not place the ownership or accountability for theimplementation project on the personnel who will operate the system. Thislack of ownership can lead to a situation in which the implementationbecomes an IT project rather than a company-wide project.40Chapter 2\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In addition, training was crucial —along with a\\nproject champion, that is, someone who might not be in the CEO role butwho brings enthusiasm and leadership to a project.\\n•ERP implementation brings a tremendous amount of change for users of thesystem. Managers need to effectively manage that change in order to ensure asmooth implementation.\\nMany ERP implementation experts emphasize the importance of proper education\\nand training for both employees and managers. Most people will naturally resist changing\\nthe way they do their jobs. Many analysts have noted that active top managementsupport is crucial for successful acceptance and implementation of such company-wide\\nchanges.\\nSome companies willingly part with funds for software and new hardware, but they do\\nnot properly budget for employee training. ERP software is complex and can beintimidating at first. This fact alone supports the case for adequate training. Gartner\\nResearch recommends allocating 17 percent of a project ’s budget to training. Those\\ncompanies spending less than 13 percent on training are three times more likely to have\\nproblems with their ERP implementations. The cost includes training employees on how to\\nuse the software to do their job, employees ’nonproductive downtime during training,\\nand— very importantly —educating employees about how the data they control affect the\\nentire business operation.\\nNestlé learned many lessons from its implementation of an ERP system. Its six-year,\\n$210 million project was initially headed for failure because Nestlé didn ’t include on the\\nimplementation team any employees from the operating groups affected. Employees leftthe company, morale was down, and help desk calls were up. After three years, the ERPimplementation was temporarily stopped. Nestlé USA ’s vice president and CIO at that\\ntime, Jeri Dunn, learned that major software implementation projects are not really aboutthe software, rather they are about change management. “When you move to SAP, you are\\nchanging the way people work …. You are challenging their principles, their beliefs, and\\nthe way they have done things for many, many years, ”said Dunn. After addressing the\\ninitial problems, Nestlé ultimately reaped benefits from its ERP installation.\\nFor many companies, it takes years before they can take full advantage of the wide\\nvariety of capabilities of their ERP systems. Most ERP installations do generate returns,and news coverage now focuses on how companies gain value from their existing systems\\nor are upgrading and adding functionality to their existing ERP systems. Del Monte Foods\\nneeded to meet Walmart ’s and Target’s requirements for package tracking using radio\\nfrequency identification devices (RFIDs), so approximately a year after its ERP system\\ninstallation, the company tied its RFID applications into its existing SAP platform and is\\nworking to make its supply chain more efficient.\\nThe Continuing Evolution of ERP\\nUnderstanding the social and business implications of new technologies is not easy.Howard H.

The growth in the computing power of mobile devicessuch as smartphones and tablets will create more opportunities for ERP companies to\\ndevelop applications that provide customers with instantaneous data while improving\\ntheir efficiency.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nERP Allows for Bakery Chain Expansion\\nAu Bon Pain, the bakery and café chain based in Boston, operates 200 outlets in the\\nUnited States and Asia. Over the last three years, Health magazine has named Au Bon\\nPain one of America ’s top five healthiest fast-food restaurant chains. The company had\\nan interest in expanding, and Tim Oliveri, the company ’s chief financial officer, wanted\\nAu Bon Pain to be able to react to market changes more rapidly while also reducing its costs.\\nThe company ’s existing legacy information systems were holding it back, but the company ’s\\ndecision to implement an SAP ERP system is now helping it achieve these goals.\\nThe new ERP system replaced disparate systems, some of which were in paper\\nformat. This integrated enterprise system brings the storefront to the back office through\\na number of different module implementations. With the single system, the company isable to reduce its financial reporting cycle from weeks to days, and the system allowsbetter management of Au Bon Pain ’s workforce through a Web-based portal. In addition,\\nthe new system facilitates greater compliance with financial regulations and better salesmanagement, along with the electronic purchasing of all raw materials.\\nOne impetus for installing this ERP system was for management to be able to digest\\ninformation on market conditions, and react quickly to open new stores or renovateexisting stores. For example, cafés in New York City have recently undergone majorrenovations, resulting in double-digit sales increases. More cafes are planned toopen soon.\\nQuestion:\\n1. Assume you own and run a small local coffee shop. You do all your ordering of\\ningredients for your coffee shop by hand —using pencil, paper, mail, and\\ntelephone.

One of the\\nlatest lawsuits is by Montclair State University in New Jersey, which is suing Oracle for afailed implementation. Originally, the school contracted with Oracle (PeopleSoft) to buy anERP package for $4.3 million, with an additional $15.75 million for the implementation.The following year, after some delays, Oracle sought an additional $8 million to complete theproject. Montclair University refused the additional fee, and Oracle left the project. NowMontclair is estimating that it will take it a further $20 million to complete theimplementation.\\nExperts agree that lawsuits such as these are not productive; no one really wins. It is\\nessential that customers pay close inspection to the legal contract drawn up betweenthemselves and the software vendor. ERP software is extremely complex, and it is oftendifficult to ask the right questions when negotiating the contracts. Most importantly, thecustomer should understand its own business processes and be able to relay them to thesoftware vendor. The customer must also accept that their business processes will needto change to fit the software. To top it off, the pricing of many ERP packages is verycomplex, with a variety of different licensing models to choose from. The bottom line is:Understand the contract you are signing.\\nQuestion:\\n1. Research the topic of ERP contracts on the Internet. How could ERP vendors\\nmake it easier for customers to understand their licensing models? Whatcould customers do to ensure a contract contains all possible eventualities?43The Development of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The software couldintegrate a company ’s entire business by using a common database that linked all\\noperations, allowing real-time data sharing and streamlined operations.\\n•SAP R/3, now called SAP ERP, is modular software offering modules for Sales andDistribution, Materials Management, Production Planning, Quality Management, andother areas.\\n•ERP software is expensive to purchase and time consuming to implement, and itrequires significant employee training —but the payoffs can be spectacular. For some\\ncompanies, however, the ROI may not be immediate or even calculable.\\n•Experts anticipate that ERP ’s future focus will be on applications for mobile devices\\nand providing instant access to large volumes of data.\\nKey Terms\\nAdvanced Business Application\\nProgramming (ABAP)\\nAsset Management (AM) module\\nbest practiceclient-server architectureControlling (CO) moduledatabase management system (DBMS)electronic data interchange (EDI)Financial Accounting (FI) moduleHuman Resources (HR) modulelegacy systemmaterial requirements planning (MRP)Materials Management (MM) modulemoduleopen architecturePlant Maintenance (PM) moduleProduction Planning (PP) moduleProject System (PS) moduleQuality Management (QM) moduleR/3return on investment (ROI)Sales and Distribution (SD) moduleSAP ERPScalabilitysilotolerance groupWorkflow (WF) module44Chapter 2\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Because Marketing and Sales is responsible for selling the company ’s product, and those\\nsales are the company ’s only source of revenue. That means marketing personnel often guide the\\ncompany ’s key strategies and tactics by making decisions regarding such critical questions as:\\n•What products should we produce?\\n•How much of each product should we produce?\\n•How can we best promote and advertise our products?\\n•How should we distribute our products for maximum customer satisfaction?\\n•What price should we charge for our products?\\nOn a day-to-day basis, Marketing and Sales is involved in generating key transaction data\\n(including data for recording sales), creating customers ’invoices, and allocating credit to customers.\\nAs you learned in previous chapters, the availability of a common database is one of the advantages\\nof having an integrated information system, because the data in the system are consistent across the\\ndifferent modules. Integration can lead to problems, however. If the data are not correct, the error will\\ncarry over into all modules.\\nAs noted above, Fitter ’s Marketing and Sales information systems are currently not well\\nintegrated with the company ’s other information systems. Because of this, company-wide use of\\ntransaction data is inefficient, as you will see later in this chapter. You will also learn how Fitter ’s\\nMarketing and Sales information systems could be improved by using ERP software. We begin by\\nlooking at an overview of the company ’s operations.\\nOVERVIEW OF FITTER SNACKER\\nFitter Snacker manufactures and sells two types of nutritious snack bars: NRG-A and\\nNRG-B. The NRG-A bar touts “advanced energy, ”and NRG-B boasts “body-building\\nproteins. ”Each bar contains a mix of the following ingredients:\\n•Dry base mixture: oats, wheat germ, protein powder, and spices50Chapter 3\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.•Wet base mixture: honey and canola oil\\n•Vitamins and minerals\\nEach type of bar contains additional unique ingredients: NRG-A contains carob chips\\nand raisins, and NRG-B contains hazelnuts and dates.\\nFitter ’s sales force is organized into two groups: the Wholesale Division and the Direct\\nSales Division. The Wholesale Division sells to intermediaries that distribute the bars to\\nsmall shops, vending machine operators, and health food stores. The Direct Sales Divisionsells directly to large grocery stores, sporting goods stores, and other large chain stores.\\nThe two divisions operate separately from one another, in effect breaking the Marketing\\nand Sales functional area into two pieces. Each division has an organizational structurethat interacts with Fitter ’s other functional areas, such as Accounting and Finance and\\nSupply Chain Management.\\nThe two sales divisions differ primarily in terms of order volume and pricing terms.\\nThe Direct Sales Division offers customers volume discounts to encourage larger sales\\norders, which are more efficient to process. The Wholesale Division charges customers\\na lower fixed price because the orders are usually large. Each order— regardless of size —\\ngenerates costs related to the paperwork, shipping, and handling of the order. Thus, an\\norder of 500 cases of snack bars incurs the same handling costs as an order of 10 cases.\\nHowever, the large order might generate $5,000 in profit, while the small order mightgenerate only $100. Both divisions send their customers invoices requesting the total\\nbalance within 30 days and offering a 2 percent discount if the customer pays within\\n10 days (2– 10/net 30).\\nIn addition to selling snack bars under the Fitter Snacker brand name, the company\\nalso packages the bars in store-brand wrappers for some chain stores.\\nPROBLEMS WITH FITTER SNACKER ’S SALES PROCESS\\nMany of Fitter ’s sales orders have some sort of problem, such as incorrect pricing,\\nexcessive calls to the customer for information, order-processing delays, missed deliverydates, and so on. These problems occur because Fitter has three separate informationsystems: the sales order system, the warehouse system, and the accounting system.\\nInformation from each system is shared either electronically through periodic file\\ntransfers (sales order system to accounting system) or manually by paper printout (creditstatus from the Accounting Department to sales clerks). The high number of manual\\ntransactions creates many opportunities for data entry errors. Further, not all the\\ninformation stored in the three systems is available in real time, resulting in incorrectprices and credit information.\\nIn each sales division, Fitter has four salespeople who work on the road, plus two\\nclerks who work in the sales office. Salespeople work on commission and have someleeway in offering customers “discretionary discounts ”to make a sale. The entire sales\\nprocess involves a series of steps that require coordination between Sales, Warehouse,Accounting, and Receiving, as shown in Figure 3-1. (Notice that Production is not directlyinvolved in the sales process because Fitter plans production using a make-to-stock\\nstrategy, with product shipped to customers from warehouse inventory rather than being\\nmanufactured for specific orders.)51Marketing Information Systems and the Sales Order Process\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

For a new customer, the sales process\\nbegins with a sales call, which might be over the telephone or in person. At the end of the\\nsales call, the salesperson prepares a handwritten quotation on a form that generates two\\ncopies. The original quotation goes to the customer, and the middle copy is first faxed andthen mailed to the sales office; the salesperson keeps the bottom copy for his or her\\nrecords. On the quotation form is a toll-free number that the customer can call to place an\\norder.\\nA number of problems can occur with this process, including the following:\\n•The salesperson might make an error in the sales quotation. For example,a salesperson in the Direct Sales Division might offer both a quantitydiscount and a discretionary discount. If the salesperson is not careful, the\\ntwo discounts combined might be so deep that the company makes little or\\nno profit on the order.\\n•Salespeople fax a copy of their sales quotations to the sales office, but\\nsometimes a customer calls to place an order before the fax is transmitted.52Chapter 3\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.In such cases, the sales clerk has no knowledge of the terms of the sale\\n(which are outlined on the quotation) and must ask the customer to repeat\\nthe information. On the other hand, even if the quotation has been faxed, the\\ndata might not have been entered into the customer database, so thecustomer might still need to repeat the order information. This situation can\\nalso lead to a duplicate order.\\n•The fax received by the sales office is a copy of a handwritten form, and\\nmight not be legible.\\nWhen customers place an order, they usually inquire about the delivery date. To get a\\nshipping date, the sales clerk must contact the warehouse supervisor and ask whether thecustomer ’s order can be immediately shipped from inventory, or whether shipping will\\nbe delayed until a future production run is delivered to the warehouse. However, becausethe warehouse supervisor is generally too busy to get an updated inventory count, total allthe orders waiting to be filled, and find out how many other orders are in process in the\\nsales office, she can only estimate the shipping date.\\nOnce the sales clerk has the warehouse supervisor ’s estimated shipping date, she\\ndetermines the shipping method and how long delivery will take. Next, the clerk checks thecustomer ’s credit status. For new customers, the clerk fills out a paper credit-check form\\nthat includes basic customer data and the amount of the order. The form goes to\\nAccounting, where accountants perform the credit check and then return the credit-check\\nform showing the customer ’s credit limit. If the order is from an existing customer, the clerk\\nchecks a paper report from Accounting that shows the customer ’s current balance, credit\\nlimit, and available balance. However, because the report is generated weekly, it might notreflect a customer ’s most recent payments or orders. If a customer ’s available credit is less\\nthan the amount of the current order, assuming there are no other orders outstanding,\\nthe clerk calls the customer to determine what action the customer wants to take\\n(reduce the amount of the order, prepay, or dispute the amount of credit granted).\\nOnce the order details have been finalized, the sales clerk enters the order into the\\norder-entry system. The computer program performs four important tasks. First, it storesthe customer ’s order data, which are used later to analyze sales performance at the\\ndivision level. Second, it prints out a packing list and shipping labels for the warehouse to\\nuse to pick, pack, and ship the customer ’s order. Third, it produces a data file of all\\ncurrent transactions for the Accounting Department to use for preparing invoices (thisfile is also used for financial, tax, and managerial accounting, which is discussed inChapter 5). And fourth, the data file is copied to a USB key each evening for uploading\\ninto the company ’s PC-based accounting system.\\nOrder Filling\\nFitter ’s process for filling an order is no more efficient than its sales order process. Packing\\nlists and shipping labels are printed in the sales department twice a day— at noon and at\\nthe end of the day. These are carried by hand to the warehouse, where they are manually\\nsorted into small orders and large orders.\\nThe Production Department produces and wraps the snack bars and packs them in\\ndisplay boxes, 24 bars to a box. The display boxes have promotional printing and aredesigned to serve as a display case. Fitter packs 12 display boxes together to form a standard\\nshipping case. The warehouse stores both individual display boxes and shipping cases,\\norganized by label type (Fitter brand and store brand), so depending on the inventory levels53Marketing Information Systems and the Sales Order Process\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

If there are not enough individual display boxes in the warehouse to fill the order, the\\npicker might break open a shipping case to get the required number of display boxes. If he\\ndoes this, he is supposed to advise the warehouse supervisor so she can update theinventory records —but sometimes this step is overlooked.\\nThe picker then brings the display boxes back to the small-order packing area, where\\nthey are packed into a labeled box —with the packing list enclosed —and prepared for\\nshipping by a small package shipper.\\nFor large orders (one or more shipping cases), the picker uses a forklift to move the\\nappropriate number of shipping cases to the large-order packing area. Workers label themfor shipping, load them on a pallet, and attach them to the pallet with shrink-wrap plastic\\nfor protection. These pallets are shipped either by one of Fitter ’s two delivery trucks or by\\na less-than-truckload (LTL) common carrier.\\nFitter uses a PC database program to manage inventory levels in the warehouse. The\\nprogram adjusts inventory level figures on a daily basis, using data from production records\\n(showing what has been added to the warehouse), packing lists (showing what has beenshipped from the warehouse), and any additional sources of data (such as shipping cases\\nthat have been opened to pull display boxes). Each month the warehouse staff conducts a\\nphysical inventory count to compare the actual inventory on hand with what the inventoryrecords in the database show. Fitter ’s monthly inventory counts show that inventory records\\nare more than 95 percent accurate. Although 95 percent accuracy may not sound too bad,having 5 percent errors means that Fitter regularly has problems filling orders.\\nBecause snack bars are somewhat perishable, Fitter keeps inventory levels fairly low.\\nInventory levels change rapidly during the day, and Fitter ’s current system does not\\nprovide a good method for checking inventory availability. As a result, a picker might go tothe shelves to pick an order and discover that there are not enough snack bars to fill the\\norder. In this case, there are several possible outcomes:\\n•There might be more of that type of bar in the production area —ready to be\\ntransferred to the warehouse— in which case the picker could wait until the\\ninventory is received into the warehouse to finish picking the order.\\n•For an important customer that purchases store-branded snack bars, production\\nmight change the wrappers and display box labels currently on the productionline to the customer ’s brand to produce enough bars to complete the order.\\n•In other situations, the customer may be willing to take a partial shipmentconsisting of whatever is on hand, with the rest shipped when it becomesavailable —which is known as a backorder.\\n•Or, the customer might prefer to take the goods on hand, cancel the balanceof the order, and place a new order later.\\n•If the customer ’s company has enough inventory on hand, the customer may\\nprefer to wait until the whole order can be shipped, thus saving on deliverycharges.\\nTo determine what to do in this situation, the order picker might have conversations\\nwith the warehouse supervisor, production supervisor, and sales clerks. Whatever the final\\ndecision, the warehouse supervisor has to contact the sales clerk so she can notify the54Chapter 3\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

First, the data from the current order-entry\\nsystem is only loaded into the accounting system at the end of each day, so the\\nAccounting Department does not have information on new sales orders until the followingday. In addition, clerks must manually make adjustments in both the order-entry system\\nand the accounting system for partial shipments and for any other changes that have\\noccurred during the order-fulfillment process. Many times these corrections are not madein both systems, causing discrepancies that must be corrected at the end of the month, at\\nwhich point it is more difficult for the parties involved to remember what happened.\\nDelayed order corrections also sometimes result in late or inaccurate invoices. If thecompleted invoice is waiting to be mailed when the warehouse notifies Accounting of a\\npartial shipment, then a new invoice must be prepared. In any case, an invoice is\\neventually sent to the customer, separate from the shipment.\\nPayment and Returns\\nFitter ’s procedure for processing payments often yields frustrating results for customers.\\nAlmost all customers pay the invoice within 10 days to receive the 2 percent discount. If anyerrors have occurred in the sales or order-fulfillment process —from the original quotation to\\nentering the order into the sales order program to filling the order in the warehouse —the\\ncustomer will receive an incorrect invoice. Even though Fitter provides customers with twoinvoice copies, many customers do not return a copy of the invoice with their payment, asinstructed. Errors sometimes result in the incorrect customer ’s account being credited.\\nFitter ’s returns processing is also flawed. Because Fitter ’s snack bars contain no\\npreservatives, they have a relatively short shelf life. Thus, the company has a policy ofcrediting customer accounts for returned snack bars that have exceeded their “sell by ”\\ndate (this is a generous policy, because it is impossible to know who —Fitter or the\\ncustomer —is responsible for the bars not selling before they expire). Fitter also gives\\ncredit for damaged or defective cases returned by customers. Customers are supposed to\\ncall Fitter to get a returned material authorization (RMA) number to simplify the crediting\\nprocess. When cases are returned to Fitter, the Receiving Department completes ahandwritten returned material sheet, listing the returning customer ’s name, the materials\\nreturned, and the RMA number. However, many customers do not call for the RMAnumber, or fail to include it with their returned material, which makes it more difficult forthe Accounting Department to credit the appropriate account. Poor penmanship on the\\nreturned material sheet also creates problems for Accounting.\\nWhen an account becomes past due, Fitter sends a dunning letter, which is the term\\nfor a letter notifying a customer that their account is past due and requesting payment ifpayment has not already been sent. As the account gets more delinquent, the dunning\\nletters usually get more direct and threatening. If a customer ’s account has not been\\nproperly credited, however, the customer may receive a dunning letter in error, or may\\nreceive a call about exceeding their credit limit after placing a new order. Such situations\\ndamage goodwill with both new and repeat customers.\\nIn the following sections, you will learn how an ERP system could improve the sales\\nprocess for Fitter Snacker.55Marketing Information Systems and the Sales Order Process\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Because an ERP\\nsystem uses a common database, it can minimize data entry errors and provide accurate\\ninformation in real time to all users. An ERP system can also track all transaction data (suchas invoices, packing lists, RMA numbers, and payments) involved in the sales order process.\\nWe will look at how one ERP system, SAP ERP —in particular, its Sales and Distribution\\nmodule —manages the sales order process. (Other ERP software handles the process in a\\nsimilar fashion.) In SAP ERP, important transactions and events are assigned a number for\\nrecord-keeping purposes. The electronic evidence of a transaction in SAP ERP is called a\\n“document. ”\\nThe SAP ERP Sales and Distribution module treats the sales order process as a cycle\\nof events. SAP ERP defines up to six events for any sale:\\n•Presales activities\\n•Sales order processing\\n•Inventory sourcing\\n•Delivery\\n•Billing\\n•Payment\\nPresales Activities\\nThe first step in the SAP ERP sales and distribution process is presales activities. At this\\nphase, customers can get pricing information about the company ’s products, either\\nthrough an inquiry or a sales quotation. The difference between an inquiry and a\\nquotation is that a quotation is a written, binding document; the seller guarantees the\\nbuyer that, for some specified period of time, he can buy the product at the quoted price.\\nAn inquiry is simply a statement of prices, with no guarantee implied. In either case, theevent is recorded in the central database.\\nPresales activities also include marketing activities such as tracking customer\\ncontacts —including sales calls, visits, and mailings. A company can maintain customer\\ndata in the ERP system and generate mailing lists based on specific customer\\ncharacteristics, which enhances targeted marketing efforts.\\nSales Order Processing\\nIn the SAP ERP system, sales order processing is the series of activities that must take place to\\nrecord a sales order. The sales order can start from a quotation or inquiry generated in thepresales step. Any information that was collected from the customer to support the quotation\\n(contact name, address, phone number) is immediately included in the sales order.\\nCritical sales order processing steps include recording the items to be purchased,\\ndetermining the selling price, and recording the order quantities. Users can definevarious pricing alternatives in the SAP ERP system. For example, a company can use\\nproduct-specific pricing, such as establishi ng quantity discounts for a particular item,\\nor it can define discounts that depend on both the product and a particular customer.\\nConfiguring a complex pricing scheme requires a significant amount of programming\\nwork, but once the system is in place, it will automatically calculate the correctprice for each customer, eliminating many of the problems that Fitter currently\\nexperiences.56Chapter 3\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.During sales order processing, the SAP ERP system checks the accounts receivable\\ntables in the SAP ERP database to confirm the customer ’s available credit. SAP ERP adds\\nthe value of the order to the customer ’s credit balance, and then compares the result to\\nthe customer ’s credit limit (also available in the database). If the customer has sufficient\\ncredit available, the order is completed. If not, the SAP ERP system prompts sales\\npersonnel to reject the order, call the customer to check on recent payments, or contact\\nAccounting to discuss any extenuating circumstances.\\nInventory Sourcing\\nWhen recording an order, the SAP ERP system checks the company ’s inventory records\\nand the production planning records to see whether the requested material is available\\nand can be delivered on the date the customer desires. This available-to-promise (ATP)\\ncheck includes the expected shipping time, taking into account weekends and holidays.In the SAP ERP system, availability is automatically checked, and the system can\\nrecommend an increase in planned production if a shortfall is expected. SAP also keeps a\\nrecord of all open orders, so even if product for a particular order is still in the warehouse,the system will not allow it to be sold to another customer.\\nDelivery\\nIn the SAP ERP system, creating a delivery means releasing the documents that the\\nwarehouse uses to pick, pack, and ship orders— rather than the traditional definition of\\ntransferring goods. The process allows deliveries to be created so the warehouse andshipping activities are carried out efficiently (for example, combining similar orders for\\npicking, or grouping orders based on shipping method and destination).\\nOnce the system has created the documents for picking, packing, and shipping, the\\ndocuments are transferred to the Materials Management module, where the warehouseactivities of picking, packing, and shipping are carried out.\\nBilling\\nNext, the SAP ERP system creates an invoice by copying the sales order data into the\\ninvoice document. Accounting can print this document and mail it, fax it, or transmit itelectronically to the customer. Accounting records are also updated at this point. To\\nrecord the sale, SAP ERP debits (increases) accounts receivable and credits sales, thus\\nupdating the accounting records automatically.\\nPayment\\nWhen the customer sends in a payment, this payment must be recorded in the SAPsystem. If the payment is made electronically, it can be automatically processed by the\\nSAP ERP system, which records the payment as an electronic sales order document,\\ndebits the cash account, and credits (reduces) the customer ’s account balance. If the\\ncustomer sends a check, a clerk must manually enter the payment information, at which\\npoint the system updates all information related to the sale. The timely recording of this\\ntransaction has an effect on the timeliness and accuracy of any subsequent credit checksfor the customer. With its current systems, Fitter has had a problem with getting accurate\\ncredit checks, frequently blocking orders for customers that are within their credit limit,\\nwhile granting credit to other companies beyond what is advisable.57Marketing Information Systems and the Sales Order Process\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Because more than\\none customer might have the same name, a unique number is assigned by the company to\\neach customer in the database. This number acts as the primary identifier for thecustomer. The same logic applies to distinguishing one inventory item from another. In\\ndatabase terminology, such codes are called key fields. For most data entry fields, the SAP\\nERP system determines whether an entry is valid. Figure 3-4 shows how SAP ERP lists the\\nsystem ’s 34 predefined sales order document types.

These data are referred to as customer master data . Master data are data\\nthat remain fairly stable, such as customer name and address. Master data are maintained\\nin the central database, and are available to all SAP ERP modules, including SD (Sales andDistribution), FI (Financial), and CO (Controlling).\\nInformation about materials is in tables —collectively called material master data —\\nwhich are used by the MM (Materials Management) and PP (Production Planning) modulesin addition to the Sales and Distribution module.\\nThe SAP ERP system allows a company to define various ways to group its customers\\nand salespeople. These groupings are called organizational structures . One important\\norganizational structure for Fitter Snacker is the Distribution Channel. With SAP ERP, the\\nDistribution Channel allows the user to define different ways for materials to be sold and\\ndistributed to the customer. The Distribution Channel structure also allows for differenttypes of relationships with different customers, and it lets the company specify aspects of\\nthe relationship, such as pricing, delivery method, and minimum order quantities.\\nDefining a Wholesale Distribution Channel and a Direct Sales Distribution Channel forFitter would help to ensure that customers ’orders are correctly priced.

Because the SAP ERP system records the customer ’s PO number, a Fitter\\nemployee can look up the status of the order using the customer ’s PO number. Alternatively,\\nthe order can be located using the sales order number that SAP assigns to this transaction.\\nNotice also that the order screen shows the name of the customer (West Hills Athletic\\nClub) and the names of the products (NRG-A and NRG-B), even though they were not entered\\ndirectly during the order process. How did they get on the screen at this point? Once the\\ncompany or product code is entered, the clerk can easily request the SAP ERP system to searchthe database and access all the information needed to complete the order. Thus, the SAP ERP\\nsystem simplifies the data entry tasks, reducing data entry time and the possibility of error.\\nWhen the SAP ERP system is instructed to save a sales order, it performs inventory\\nsourcing —that is, it carries out checks to ensure that the customer ’ss a l e so r d e rc a nb e\\ndelivered on the requested delivery date. Remember that previously when a customer wanted\\nto know when an order could be delivered, the sales clerk had to make a series of phone calls.In the SAP ERP system, this process is handled automatically. The system performs a check on\\nboth inventory and production, and it takes into account the time required for shipping. When\\nthe requested delivery date cannot be met, the SAP ERP system automatically proposesalternatives to the sales order clerk. For example, Figure 3-8 shows what the sales order clerk\\nwill see if only five cases of NRG-A bars will be available by the requested delivery date. The\\nSAP ERP system provides the sales order clerk with three alternatives:\\n1. Reduce the order quantity of NRG-A cases to five, which can be delivered by\\nthe requested delivery date.\\n2. Delay shipment of the NRG-A bars for three days, when 10 cases will be available.\\n3. Ship five cases by the requested delivery date, and ship five cases at the later date.\\nThree options\\nproposedby SAP ERP\\nSource Line: SAP AG.\\nFIGURE 3-8 Order proposals62Chapter 3\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

With Fitter ’s\\nunintegrated systems, it could take days for the customer to find out that its requested\\ndelivery date could not be met.\\nWhen a sales order is saved, the SAP ERP system assigns a document number to the\\nsales order transaction. In the SAP ERP system, a document is an electronic record of abusiness transaction, and a document number is created for each business transaction.\\nWhen the sales order is ready to be processed by the warehouse, a delivery document will\\nbe created with its own unique document number, which the system will link to the salesorder document. Finally, when the bill (invoice) is prepared for the customer, the bill ’s\\nunique number (called the invoice number) will be created and linked to all the othernumbers associated with the sales order.\\nThe SAP ERP system has a mechanism for keeping track of the document numbers\\nassociated with each sales order so employees can track the status of an order while it isin process or research it after shipping. The linked set of document numbers related toa sales order, also known as the audit trail , is called the document flow in SAP ERP.\\nFigure 3-9 shows the document flow for a completed order.\\nAccounting\\ndocument90000002 islinked to\\nsales order 5\\nSource Line: SAP AG.\\nFIGURE 3-9 The Document Flow tool, which links sales order documents\\nIf an order includes partial shipments, partial payments, and returned material credits,\\nthe document flow can become quite complex.

Not only does the document flow show all documents related to a sales order,\\nbut the user can look at the details of each document simply by double-clicking a line in thedocument flow. For example, if West Hills Athletic Club chose to take delivery of five cases\\nof NRG-A bars on its requested delivery date and five cases when they became available, a\\nsales order clerk can easily check on the status of the five delayed cases using documentflow. He or she can search the SAP system to find the original sales order by a number of\\nmethods (open orders for West Hills, the PO number that West Hills used, the sales order63Marketing Information Systems and the Sales Order Process\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

As another example, a customer may have a question about\\nan invoice it has received. The clerk can search the SAP ERP system for the invoice, and\\nthe document flow will show all activity that led to the invoice. With an unintegratedinformation system, researching the invoice would require checking more than one\\ninformation system and perhaps searching paper records as well.\\nDiscount Pricing in SAP ERP\\nWhen a company installs an ERP system, it can configure it for a number of pricing\\nstrategies. For example, various kinds of discounts can be allowed (based on item numberor for all items, based on unit price or total order value, with or without shipping charges\\nand taxes, by individual customer, by a class of customer, and so on). As a safeguard, the\\nsystem can enforce limits on the size of discounts to keep salespeople from offeringunprofitable or unapproved discounts.\\nSuppose a salesperson wants to give a certain customer a 10 percent discretionary\\ndiscount on NRG-A bars. But is the salesperson allowed to discount those bars? Is thatdiscount appropriate for that customer? If so, will the discount be so deep that the sale\\nwill be unprofitable for Fitter? An ERP system automatically answers these questions.\\nPricing, the process of determining how much to charge a particular customer, can be\\nvery complex. To accommodate the various ways that companies offer price discounts,SAP has developed a control mechanism it calls the condition technique . While detailed\\ndiscussion of the condition technique is beyond the scope of this text, Figure 3-10 shows\\nhow a discount is automatically applied in the SAP ERP system.\\nNet price for\\norder, includingdiscounts\\nBase price is$240/case\\nThe productioncost of the 10cases is $1,992Discount is10 percent\\nSource Line: SAP AG.\\nFIGURE 3-10 Pricing conditions for sales order64Chapter 3\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Figure 3-10 also shows that Fitter will still makea profit on this order, because the cost to produce 10 cases of NRG-A bars is $1,992.\\nIntegration of Sales and Accounting\\nIn Fitter ’s old system, sales records were not integrated with the company ’s accounting\\nrecords, so Accounting often did not have the most up-to-date information. By contrast,ERP systems integrate Accounting with all business processes, so when a sales order isrecorded, the related accounting data are updated automatically.\\nIn the document flow shown in Figure 3-9, Accounting document 90000002 is part of\\nthe sales order process. The clerk can select this line, and then click the Displaydocument button to get the accounting detail shown in Figure 3-12.65Marketing Information Systems and the Sales Order Process\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

These amounts represent the list\\nprices of the snack bars on the order. The 10 percent discount is applied to the NRG-A\\nbars ($240) and NRG-B bars ($295) dollars and is recorded in the Sales Discount account(account number 610000).

Take Fitter Snacker, for example. Say a salesperson calls on a goodcustomer, Health Express. The salesperson offers Health Express deep discounts for buying a\\ncertain number of NRG bars. At the same time, the Marketing Department is running a sale66Chapter 3\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

Marketing sends Health Express a flyer advertising the discounted price, which\\nis less than what the salesperson just offered in person. Meanwhile, the vice president of Fitter\\nplays golf with the CEO of Health Express and offers yet another discount. The connection or\\nrelationship with the customer is confused because the customer is receiving inconsistentinformation. Customer relationship management (CRM) software can help companies\\nstreamline their interactions with customers to ensure a consistent message.\\nAn ERP system offers a company an added benefit beyond systems integration:\\nvast and complete quantities of data available for analysis. By adding other software tools\\nto its ERP system, a company can extend the capabilities of the system, thus increasing\\nits value. Many ERP vendors —and non-ERP software companies —provide CRM software.\\nIn 2011, the CRM software market was worth $12 billion and was forecasted to grow to\\n$25 billion by 2018.

(With\\non-demand CRM , the software and computer equipment reside with the CRM provider;\\nit is not installed in-house.) In 2006, SAP responded to competition from on-demand\\nproviders with CRM OnDemand. This product was essentially a hosted version of its CRM\\nsoftware with a few minor changes. In 2011, SAP introduced Sales OnDemand, based on\\nits BusinessByDesign platform, which is a CRM product with a focus on sales.\\nWith the goal of providing “a single face to the customer, ”the basic principle behind\\nCRM is that any employee in contact with the customer should have access to allinformation about the company ’s past interactions with the customer. In a traditional sales\\norganization, information might only be available to one individual, who might not share it\\nwith the organization. If that individual leaves the company, the information is lost.\\nCore CRM Activities\\nIn general, CRM software supports the following activities and tools:\\n•One-to-one marketing —Once a customer is categorized, for example, based\\non the products they buy and the volume in which they buy those products,\\nthe company can tailor products, promotions, and pricing accordingly.\\nCustomers can be offered products related to what they are now buying\\n(cross-selling), or the company could choose to promote higher-marginproducts in the same lines (up-selling) to those customers.\\n•Sales force automation (SFA) —Using the CRM software, occurrences of\\ncustomer contacts are logged in the company ’s database. The SFA feature\\nof CRM software can automatically route certain customers who contact the\\ncompany to a particular sales representative. Companies can also use SFA\\ntools to forecast customer needs, based on the customer ’s history and\\ntransactions, and to alert sales representatives accordingly. Sometimes this\\nsoftware is called “lead management software ”because a transaction can be\\ntracked from the initial lead to post-sale follow-up.\\n•Sales campaign management —This software feature lets a company\\norganize a marketing campaign and compile its results automatically.\\n•Marketing encyclopedias —This feature serves as a database of promotional\\nliterature about products.

With global ATP, the system automatically checks allfacilities and determines the most cost-efficient facility to use to meet the customer ’s\\nrequest.\\nSAP’s approach to CRM is to provide a set of tools to manage the three basic task\\nareas, or jobs, related to customers: marketing, sales, and service. These task areas\\ncontribute to the cultivation of the customer relationship. This cultivation goes\\nthrough four phases, as defined by SAP: prospecting, acquiring, servicing, andretaining.\\nIn prospecting, a potential new customer (or potential new business opportunity with an\\nexisting customer) is evaluated, and development activities (emails, sales calls, mailings, etc.)are planned to develop the prospective business. Marketing tasks predominate in this phase.\\nIn acquiring, salespeople develop business prospects into customers. Marketing is still\\nthe critical task, but the sales tasks (processing inquiries, quotes, and eventually salesorders) become increasingly important in this phase.\\nOnce sales are established with the customer, the business becomes one of servicing\\nthe account. In the servicing phase, sales tasks are still important, but service tasks(including technical support, warranty work, product returns, fixing quality problems, and\\ncomplaint handling) are critical to maintaining customer satisfaction.\\nThe rate at which prospects become customers is quite low; thus, a critical part of the\\nprocess is retaining customers. It is much easier to retain a good customer than to finda new one, so the focus of the retaining phase is making sure that current customers are\\nsatisfied by timely delivery of quality products and services at a fair price. Sales andservice tasks are still critical, but marketing tasks are again important in terms of\\nanticipating changes in customers ’requirements.\\nIn SAP CRM, the customer development cycle (prospecting, acquiring, servicing,\\nand retaining) is supported by contact channels, the methods the company uses tocommunicate with its customers. An interaction center provides contact through a variety\\nof media (phone, fax, and email). Mobile technologies and the Internet are providing anincreasingly large percentage of customer contacts. For example, the Contact Channels\\nmight aid a customer service agent on the telephone and prompt her to ask the customer\\nvarious questions relating to the account.\\nAnother set of tools in SAP CRM is Marketing and Campaign Management.\\nCompanies invest significant sums of money in marketing campaigns, which arepromotional activities that publicize the product and the company. Successful planning,execution, and evaluation are critical to gain maximum effect from these efforts.\\nFigure 3-16 shows how SAP CRM supports mar keting and campaign management.

With a CRM system in\\nplace, management can think about different performance measures; for\\nexample, should salespeople be rewarded for exceeding sales quotas, and\\nmarketing people rewarded for finding new customers— or, should both\\nreceive rewards that are based on some measure of customer satisfaction?\\nThe former approach, typical in days before CRM and ERP, can lead to\\nunintegrated functional thinking. The latter approach— now feasible with\\nCRM and ERP— can lead all personnel to think in terms of a company-wide\\neffort to satisfy customers.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nCRM and Social Media\\nCustomer relationship management tools now also include social media channels that\\nconsist of not only the more prominent ones —such as Facebook and Twitter —but also\\nblogs, wikis, YouTube, and other purpose-built Web sites. For example, Salesforce.com, acompany that provides CRM software via the Internet, has a product that searches forspecific products and brands being mentioned on social networks —important\\ninformation for companies either selling those brands or competing with those brands.Companies interested in making the most of these new CRM tools need a dedicatedgroup of personnel to manage these new channels, which must be connected with otherCRM channels. Social media channels cannot stand alone, and they cannot replace theother more traditional marketing channels.\\nThe rise in popularity of social media means that companies must find ways to\\naddress these new avenues of communication with their customers. A company needs tomake the most of any chance to connect with its customers, but these new opportunitiescan be challenging. Any response to a Facebook post or a tweet must be immediate;customers expect no less. Customer expectations have risen for response time; however,investments in the social media CRM processes and procedures are lagging. In addition,\\ncompanies have yet to calculate the return on investment for investments in social\\nmedia CRM tools.\\nGartner research has shown that 30 percent of major businesses will implement\\nsome sort of social media with CRM over the next two years in order to improvecustomer service. Both SAP and Salesforce.com have social media tools embedded intheir CRM software. Salesforce.com recently announced a new product called Data.com,which populates CRM with social media contact information, in effect, making everyaddress for every contact up to date. They also have a new component of their CRMcalled Chatter, which is a Twitter-type system for rapid internal companycommunications.\\nQuestion:\\n1.

Assume you are Fitter Snacker ’s new marketing manager, hired to clean up some of the\\ncompany ’s problems, as outlined in the beginning of this chapter. You just started this job,\\nand you are getting to know your sales team and the company ’s processes. Describe all\\nthe problems you observe about the way Fitter’ s sales force currently takes and fills an\\norder. Now convince upper management of the need to improve the existing system and\\nput an ERP system in place.\\n2. If Fitter installs an ERP system, how could they reorganize their sales division to be more\\nefficient? Be specific about how you would rearrange divisions, or consolidate them.\\n3. Fitter ’s current sales order accounting processes involves recording sales in each division\\nand then periodically sending certain sales data to Accounting for invoicing and financialreporting. Complete sales order data are retained in each sales division for businessanalysis purposes.\\nAssume that different divisions of the Yummy Foods Company buy NRG-A and NRG-B\\nbars from each of Fitter ’s sales divisions. To complicate matters, some divisions of Yummy\\nbuy store-brand bars from Fitter. (Yummy owns convenience store outlets.) Fittermanagement has asked for an analysis of the Yummy Foods account. They want todetermine if there are opportunities to expand the company ’s relationship with Yummy;\\nhowever, they want to assess the profitability of the relationship before proceeding. Themanagement team wants to see what products each division sells to Yummy, how much issold, and on what terms. Assume that in Fitter ’s current system, all the required data are\\navailable only at the sales division level. What steps will be needed to pull this company-wide analysis together? (Review how each division sells its products.) Do you think a salesdivision manager will be enthusiastic about sharing all data with his or her counterpart in\\nthe other division? Do you think there might be some reluctance? Why?\\n4. Continuing the Yummy Foods example, now assume that Fitter has an SAP ERP system\\ninstalled. Each sales division records sales in the same way.

Materials requirements planning, and the\\nextension of that process to partners in the supply chain, are important parts of today ’s ERP\\nsystems. In fact, effective supply chain management is critical to the success of companies such as\\nFitter Snacker. In this chapter, we will first examine how Fitter manages its production activities, and\\nthen we will explore some supply chain management functions in an ERP system. We will also we\\nwill look at the broader concept of supply chain management.\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.In Chapter 3, we looked at Fitter ’s sales order process, and we assumed that Fitter had enough\\nsnack bars in its warehouse to fill a typical order. Like most unintegrated manufacturing operations,\\nhowever, Fitter often has problems scheduling production. Consequently, sometimes its warehouseis not adequately stocked, and customer orders cannot be filled in a timely fashion —leading to\\ncustomer dissatisfaction and lost sales. In this chapter, you will explore Fitter ’s supply chain\\nmanagement problems and learn how ERP can help solve them.\\nPRODUCTION OVERVIEW\\nTo efficiently meet customer demand, Fitter must develop an estimate of customer\\ndemand, and then develop a production schedule to meet that forecasted demand.\\nDeveloping a production plan is a complicated task, but the end result answers two simple\\nquestions:\\n•How many of each type of snack bar should we produce, and when?\\n•What quantities of raw materials should we order so we can meet that level ofproduction, and when should they be ordered?\\nDeveloping a good production plan is just the first step: Fitter must also be able to\\nexecute the plan and make adjustments when customer demand does not meet theforecast. An ERP system is a good tool for developing and executing production plans\\nbecause it integrates the functions of production planning, purchasing, materials\\nmanagement/warehousing, quality management, sales, and accounting. To support evenbetter supply chain management, companies can connect ERP systems to supplier and\\ncustomer information systems as well.\\nIn this chapter, we will use spreadsheet examples to illustrate the logic that Fitter\\nshould be using to plan and schedule production of its NRG bars. First, we will look atFitter ’s current production process, as well as some of the associated problems that are\\ndue to Fitter ’s unintegrated systems. We will use spreadsheets to further explore the\\nplanning and scheduling logic required at each stage of the production planning process,and then we will examine the SAP ERP screens that implement this logic in an ERP\\nenvironment. Throughout the chapter, you will develop a deeper understanding of whyusing an integrated information system is superior to using unintegrated systems.\\nThe goal of production planning is to schedule production economically so a company\\ncan ship goods to its customers by the promised delivery dates in the most cost-efficientmanner. There are three general approaches to production:\\n•Make-to-stock —Items are made for inventory (the “stock ”) in anticipation of\\nsales orders; most consumer products (for example, cameras, canned corn,and books) are made this way.\\n•Make-to-order —Items are produced to fill specific customer orders;\\ncompanies usually take this approach when producing items that are tooexpensive to keep in stock or items that are made or configured to customer78Chapter 4\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Examples of make-to-order items are airplanes and large\\nindustrial equipment.\\n•Assemble-to-order —Items are produced using a combination of make-to-\\nstock and make-to-order processes; the final product is assembled for aspecific order from a selection of make-to-stock components. Personal\\ncomputers are a typical assemble-to-order product.\\nFitter ’s Manufacturing Process\\nFitter uses make-to-stock production techniques to produce its snack bars. Themanufacturing process is illustrated in Figure 4-1.\\nRaw material\\nwarehouseFinished goods\\nwarehouseMixer\\nMixer\\nMixer\\nMixerSnack bar production line\\nForm Bake Pack\\nSource Line: Course Technology/Cengage Learning.\\nFIGURE 4-1 Fitter ’s manufacturing process\\nThe snack bar production line can produce 200 bars per minute —or 12,000 bars per\\nhour. Each bar weighs 4 ounces, which means the line produces 48,000 ounces (or 3,000\\npounds) of bars per hour. The entire production line operates on one shift a day. The nextsection describes Fitter ’s production process in more detail.\\nFitter ’s Production Sequence\\nRaw materials are taken from the warehouse to one of four mixers. Each mixer mixesdough in 500-pound batches. Mixing a batch of dough requires 15 minutes of mixing time,plus another 15 minutes to unload, clean, and load the mixer for the next batch of dough;\\ntherefore, each mixer can produce two 500-pound batches of dough per hour. That means\\nthe four mixers can produce a total of 4,000 pounds of dough per hour —more than the\\nproduction line can process. Because only three mixers need to be operating at a time to\\nproduce 3,000 pounds of snack bars per hour, a mixer breakdown will not shut down the\\nproduction line.\\nAfter mixing, the dough is dumped into a hopper (bin) at the beginning of the snack\\nbar production line. A forming mechanism molds the dough into bars, which will weigh4 ounces each. Next, an automated process takes the formed bars on a conveyor beltthrough an oven that bakes the bars for 30 minutes. When the bars emerge from the oven,\\nthey are individually packaged in a foil wrapper, and each group of 24 bars is packaged\\ninto a display box. At the end of the snack bar line, display boxes are stacked on pallets(for larger orders the display boxes are first packed into shipping boxes, which are then\\nstacked on the pallets).79Production and Supply Chain Management Information Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Thus, changing production from NRG-A on one day to NRG-B\\nthe next day can be done at the end of the day without a loss of capacity. ( Capacity is the\\nmaximum amount of bars that can be produced.) On the other hand, producing two productsin one day results in a half-hour loss of capacity during the changeover.\\nFitter ’s Production Problems\\nFitter has no problems making snack bars, but it does have problems deciding how many\\nbars to make and when to make them. The manufacturing process at Fitter suffers from a\\nnumber of problems, ranging from communication breakdowns and inventory issues toaccounting inconsistencies, mainly stemming from the unintegrated nature of itsinformation systems.\\nCommunication Problems\\nCommunication breakdowns are an inherent problem in most companies, and they are\\nmagnified in a company with an unintegrated information system. For example, at Fitter,\\nMarketing and Sales personnel do a poor job of sharing information with Production\\npersonnel. Marketing and Sales frequently excludes Production from meetings, neglects toconsult Production when planning sales promotions, and often fails to even alert\\nProduction of planned promotions. Marketing and Sales also typically forgets to notify\\nProduction when it takes an exceptionally large order.\\nWhen Production must meet an unexpected increase in demand, several things\\nhappen. First, warehouse inventories are depleted. To compensate, Production mustschedule overtime labor, which results in higher production costs for products. Second,because some materials (such as ingredients, wrappers, and display boxes) are custom\\nproducts purchased from a single vendor, a sudden increase in sales demand can cause\\nshortages or even a stockout of these materials. Getting these materials to Fitter ’s plant\\nmight require expedited shipping, further increasing the cost of production. Finally,\\nunexpected spikes in demand result in high levels of frustration for Production staff.\\nProduction personnel are evaluated on their performance— how successful they are at\\ncontrolling costs, keeping manufacturing lines running, maintaining quality control, and\\noperating safely. If they cannot keep production costs down, Production staff receive poor\\nevaluations. Managers are especially frustrated when an instant need for overtime follows aperiod of low demand. With advance notice of a product promotion by Marketing and\\nSales, Production could use slack periods to build up inventory in anticipation of the\\nincrease in sales.\\nInventory Problems\\nAs noted earlier, Fitter ’s week-to-week and day-to-day production planning is not linked in\\na systematic way to expected sales levels. When deciding how much to produce, the\\nproduction manager applies rules developed through experience. Her primary indicator isthe difference between the normal amount of finished goods inventory that should be\\nstocked and the actual inventory levels of finished goods in the warehouse. Thus, if NRG-A\\nor NRG-B inventory levels seem low, the production manager schedules more bars forproduction. However, she does not want too many bars in inventory because they have a80Chapter 4\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Her judgment is also influenced by the information she hears informally\\nfrom people in Marketing and Sales about expected sales levels.\\nThe production manager ’s inventory data are maintained in an Access database. Data\\nrecords are not updated in real time and do not flag inventory that has been sold but notyet shipped. (Such inventory is not available for sale, of course, but employees cannot\\ndetermine this by looking at the database; thus, workers do not know the level of\\ninventory that is available to ship at any given moment). This is problematic if theWholesale Division generates unusually large orders or high volumes of orders. For\\nexample, two large Wholesale Division orders arriving at the same time can deplete the\\nentire available inventory of NRG-A bars. If Production is manufacturing NRG-B bars atthat time, it must halt production of those bars so it can fill the orders for NRG-A. This\\nmeans delaying production of NRG-B bars and losing production capacity due to the\\nunplanned production changeover.\\nThe production manager lacks a systematic method not only for meeting anticipated\\nsales demand, but also for adjusting production to reflect actual sales. Marketing and Salesdoes not share actual sales data with the Production Department, partly because thisinformation is hard to gather on a timely basis and partly because of a lack of trust\\nbetween the Sales and Production departments (as a result of prior negative experiences).\\nIf Production had access to sales forecasts and real-time sales order information, themanager could make timely adjustments to production, if needed. These adjustments\\nwould allow inventory levels to come much closer to what is actually needed.\\nAccounting and Purchasing Problems\\nProduction and Accounting do not have a good way to calculate the day-to-day costs of\\nFitter ’s production. Manufacturing costs are based on the number of bars produced each\\nday, a number that is measured at the end of the snack bar production line. For the\\npurpose of figuring manufacturing costs, Fitter uses standard costs , which are the normal\\ncosts of manufacturing a product; standard costs are calculated from historical data,factoring in any changes in manufacturing that have occurred since the collection of thehistorical data. For each batch of bars it produces, Fitter can estimate direct costs\\n(materials and labor) and indirect costs (factory overhead). The number of batches\\nproduced is multiplied by the standard cost of a batch, and the resulting amount ischarged to manufacturing costs.\\nMost manufacturing companies use standard costs in some way, but the method\\nrequires that standards be adjusted periodically to conform with actual costs. (Theseadjustments will be discussed in Chapter 5.) Fitter ’s actual raw material and labor costs\\noften deviate from the standard costs, in part, because Fitter is not good at controlling rawmaterials purchases. The production manager cannot give the purchasing manager a goodproduction forecast, so the purchasing manager works on two tracks: First, she tries to\\nkeep raw materials inventories high to avoid stockouts. Second, if she is offered good bulk-\\nquantity discounts on raw materials such as oats, she will buy in bulk, especially for itemsthat have long lead times for delivery. These purchasing practices make it difficult both to\\nforecast the volume of raw materials that will be on hand and to calculate an average cost\\nof the materials purchased for profitability planning. Fitter also has trouble accuratelyforecasting the average cost of labor for a batch of bars because of the frequent need for\\novertime labor.81Production and Supply Chain Management Information Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

The necessary adjustments are often quite\\nlarge, depending on production volumes and costs during the quarter.\\nExercise 4.1\\na. A convenience store chain offers to buy a very large amount of its store brand\\nhealth bars (the NRG-B bars with a customized wrapper). The chain wants a\\nlower-than-normal price because the proposed order is quadruple the size of its\\nregular order. The marketing manager asks managers from Production,\\nPurchasing, and Accounting whether the terms of the proposed deal will beprofitable. Will the managers in these areas be able to provide a reliable answer\\non short notice?\\nb. The production manager notes that current warehouse inventory levels are\\nfairly high, so the production line does not need to be run for a full eight\\nhours each day during the coming week. For several reasons, however, sheplans to run the line for eight hours a day anyway. If the line shuts down\\nworkers would still need to be paid during the idle time and overhead costs\\nwould continue to be incurred as well. Running the line full time decreasesthe average cost of bars actually produced (indirect costs can be spread over\\nmore bars). In addition, some warehoused raw materials will spoil if they\\nare not used soon. Is the production manager ’s reasoning logical? Why, or\\nwhy not?\\nTHE PRODUCTION PLANNING PROCESS\\nIn this section, you will examine a systematic process for developing a production plan\\nthat takes advantage of an ERP system. Spreadsheet calculations are presented to explain\\nand illustrate the key steps, and the corresponding screens in the SAP ERP system followthe spreadsheet data.\\nProduction planners are employees who interact with the inventory system and the\\nsales forecast to determine how much to produce. Planners follow three importantprinciples:\\n•Using a sales forecast, and taking into account current inventory levels,create an aggregate (combined) production plan for all products. Aggregateproduction plans help to simplify the planning process in two ways: First,\\nplans are made for groups of related products rather than for individual\\nproducts. Second, the time increment used in aggregate planning isfrequently a month or a quarter, while the production plans that will actually\\nbe executed operate on a daily or weekly basis. Aggregate plans should\\nconsider the available capacity in the facility.\\n•Break down the aggregate plan into more specific production plans for\\nindividual products and then into smaller time intervals.\\n•Use the production plan to determine raw material requirements.82Chapter 4\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Developing production\\ngroups can be complicated. For example, cereal manufacturers can group together\\ndifferent package sizes, or they might group together product brands (such as kids ’\\ncereals, health cereals, and so on). A consumer products company may group by product\\ntype (e.g., shampoo, laundry detergent, and disposable diapers). The aggregate production\\nplan for Fitter will combine the only two products, NRG-A and NRG-B bars, into onegroup to illustrate the process. The plan will be developed using a monthly time\\nincrement. Ultimately, the monthly production plan will be disaggregated to determine\\nweekly raw materials orders and daily production schedules.\\nThe SAP ERP Approach to Production Planning\\nThe SAP ERP approach to the production planning process is shown in Figure 4-2.

At first glance, it might seem that\\na company should just make products to match forecasted sales, but\\ndeveloping the production plan is often more complicated than that because\\ncapacity must be considered. Many products have seasonal demand, and tomeet demand during peak periods, production planners must decide whether\\nto build up inventory levels before the peak demand, increase capacity\\nduring the peak period, subcontract production, or use some combination ofthese approaches.\\n•In the Demand management step, the production plan is broken down into\\nsmaller time units, such as weekly or even daily production figures, to meetdemand for individual products.\\n•The Materials requirements planning (MRP) process determines the amount\\nand timing of raw material orders. This process answers the questions:“What raw materials should we be ordering so we can meet a particular level\\nof production?” and“When should we order these materials? ”\\n•In the Purchasing step, the quantity and timing information from the MRP\\nprocess is used to create raw materials purchase orders, which are\\ntransmitted to qualified suppliers.\\n•The Detailed scheduling process uses the production plans developed during\\nthe demand management step as an input for a production schedule. Thedetailed scheduling method used depends on the manufacturing\\nenvironment. For Fitter, the detailed production schedule will determinewhen the production line will switch between the NRG-A and NRG-B bars.\\n•The Production process uses the detailed schedule to manage daily\\noperations, answering the questions: “What should we be producing? ”and\\n“What staffing do we need to produce those products?”\\nLet’s take a more detailed look at each of these steps in the production process.\\nSales Forecasting\\nCurrently, Fitter Snacker has no formal way of developing a sales forecast and sharing itwith Production. SAP ’s ERP system would allow it to take an integrated approach to sales\\nforecasting. Whenever a sale is recorded in SAP ’s ERP Sales and Distribution (SD) module,\\nthe quantity sold is recorded as a consumption value for that material. These consumptionvalues can be updated on a weekly or monthly basis, as desired. If more detail is needed,the Logistics Information system that is part of SAP ERP can record sales with more detail\\n(for example, by region or sales office), or data can be stored in the separate Business\\nWarehouse (BW) system for more detailed analysis. With an integrated informationsystem, accurate historical sales data are available for forecasting.\\nA range of forecasting techniques can be used to predict consumer demand. One\\nsimple forecasting technique is to use a prior period ’s sales and then adjust those figures\\nfor current conditions. To make a forecast for Fitter, we can use the previous year ’s\\nsales data in combination with information on this year ’s marketing initiatives to predict\\nfuture sales.

The next line is the production plan, which the\\nproduction planner develops —in a trial-and-error fashion —by observing the effect of\\ndifferent production quantities on the lines in the spreadsheet that calculate inventory\\nlevels and capacity utilization (the amount of plant capacity that is being consumed).\\nThe third line, inventory, calculates what the inventory should be based on the\\nprevious periods inventory, sales forecast, and production plan. The plan in this exampleassumes an inventory of 100 cases as of the end of December. Adding production of 5,906\\ncases to this inventory and subtracting the forecast sales of 5,906 cases will leave an\\ninventory of 100 cases at the end of January, if things go according to plan. Theproduction planner has developed a plan that maintains a minimum planned inventory of\\napproximately 100 cases. This inventory, called safety stock , is planned so if sales demand\\nexceeds the forecast by no more than 100 cases, sales can be met without altering the\\nproduction plan. Notice that in May, the production plan is greater than the May sales\\nforecast and the inventory is 274. Why? Because the planner wants to build up inventory\\nto handle the increased demand in June, which results from the normal seasonal increasein snack bar sales and additional demand from the planned promotional activities.\\nThe fourth line shows the number of working days in a given month, an input based\\non the company calendar. Using the number of working days in a month, the availablecapacity each month is calculated in terms of the number of shipping cases:\\n•200 bars per minute ×60 minutes per hour ×8 hours per day =96,000\\nbars per day\\n•96,000 bars per day ÷24 bars per box ÷12 boxes per case =333.3 cases\\nper day86Chapter 4\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

The result\\nis expressed as the utilization percentage (line 6). This capacity calculation shows whetherFitter has the capacity necessary to meet the production plan. While higher levels of\\ncapacity utilization mean that Fitter is producing more with its production resources, this\\npercentage must be kept below 100 percent to allow for production losses due to productchangeovers, equipment breakdowns, and other unexpected production problems. The\\nsales and operations plan in Figure 4-5 shows that Fitter ’s highest level of capacity\\nutilization is 95 percent in May and June.\\nThe last step in sales and operations planning is to disaggregate the plan, that is, to\\nbreak it down into plans for individual products. Lines 7 and 8 in Figure 4-5 disaggregate\\nthe planned production shown in line 2, based on the breakdown of 70 percent NRG-A and30 percent NRG-B snack bars. This 70/30 breakdown was established using previous sales\\ndata for these products. The monthly production quantities in lines 7 and 8 are the output\\nof the sales and operations planning process, and they are the primary input to thedemand management process.\\nSuppose that Fitter is regularly able to achieve production levels at 90 percent of\\ncapacity. If the sales forecast requires more than 90 percent capacity, Fitter managementcan choose from among the following alternatives to develop a production plan:\\n•Fitter might choose not to meet all the forecasted sales demand, or it mightreduce promotional activities to decrease sales.\\n•To increase capacity, Fitter might plan to use overtime production. Doingthat, however, would increase labor cost per unit.\\n•Inventory levels could be built up in earlier months, when sales levels are\\nlower, to reduce the capacity requirements in later months. Doing that,\\nhowever, would increase inventory holding costs and increase the risk thatNRG bars held in inventory might pass their expiration date before being sold\\nby retailers.\\n•To find the right balance, management might try a hybrid approach to the\\ncapacity problem: reduce sales promotions slightly, increase production in\\nearlier months, and plan for some overtime production.\\nThe monthly production quantities (in lines 7 and 8 of Figure 4-5) create some\\ninventory in May to meet June ’s sales; in addition, some overtime production is likely in\\nMay and June because capacity utilization is over 90 percent.\\nThis example illustrates the value of an integrated system: it provides a tool for\\nincorporating data from Marketing and Sales and Manufacturing and for evaluatingdifferent plans. Whereas Marketing and Sales may want to increase sales, the company\\nmight not increase its profits if overtime costs or inventory holding costs are too high. Thissort of planning is difficult to do without an integrated information system, even for small\\ncompanies like Fitter. Having an integrated information system helps managers of all\\nfunctional areas meet corporate profit goals.87Production and Supply Chain Management Information Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Frequently, rough-cut capacity planning techniques are\\napplied to critical resources —those machines or production lines where capacity is\\nusually limited. For a company with a simple manufacturing process, these estimates\\ncan be very precise. For more complex manufacturing processes, these estimates will\\nnot be completely accurate, but they will ensure that the production plans are at leastreasonable. Managers can use SAP ERP ’s more sophisticated planning tools at the detailed\\nscheduling level, when the plans that are developed will actually be converted intomanufacturing decisions.\\nWhile an integrated ERP system like SAP can provide sophisticated tools to support\\nthe sales and operations planning process , the plan will only be successful if the\\ninterested parties are committed to the process. If Marketing and Sales andManufacturing cannot agree on sales forecasts, promotions, and production plans, then\\nthe company will find it is overstocking some items, running out of others, and spending\\na lot of money on overtime production and ex pedited shipping. Successful sales and\\noperations planning depend on developing a culture of cooperation between Marketing\\nand Sales and Manufacturing; that requires continuous support, encouragement, and\\nenforcement from top management. As you will learn in Chapter 7, changing acompany’ s culture is usually a much more difficult challenge than the technical\\nchallenge of installing new hardware and software.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nSales and Operations Planning for Blood Banks\\nSales and operations planning (SOP) is typically used in for-profit manufacturing\\norganizations; however a recent article in the Journal of Blood Services Management\\nsuggests there could be significant advantages to applying sales and operations planningconcepts to the blood-banking process. The supply chain necessary to supply blood issignificant and complex. For example, the nonprofit America ’s Blood Centers is a\\nnetwork of more than 600 donor centers supplying over 3,500 hospitals and healthcarefacilities in North America.\\nIn the article “Benefits to Blood Banks of a Sales and Operations Planning\\nProcess, ”authors Donald A. Keal and Phil Hebert make the argument that sales and\\noperations planning concepts are applicable to blood-banking systems. The key reason,they argue, is that sales and operations planning is a process “that links high-level\\nstrategic plans to day-to-day operations. ”Through the use of sales and operations\\nplanning, managers can better manage change by proactively addressing potentialproblems and opportunities.\\nOne of the unique features of blood banking is that there are customers at both ends\\nof the supply chain. Blood donors are the suppliers but are also customers for thedonation centers. While there are still a significant number of blood plasma centers thatpay for donations, most blood donation is unpaid. On the distribution end, while hospitalpatients are the recipients of donated blood, the healthcare provider is the blood bank’ s\\ncustomer.\\n(continued)92Chapter 4\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

As with any business, a blood center must quickly identify variations in\\nforecasted supply and demand and take action to lessen the potential negative effectsof those variations. For instance, if the demand for SDPs at a blood center falls belowprojections, “the excess SDPs may be exported if they have sufficient shelf life\\nremaining, or donors may be rescheduled to reduce supply. If SDP demand spikes,recruitment and collections may have to work overtime to recruit more donors.”\\nBlood banks may not be for-profit companies, but they cannot operate at a loss\\neither. The authors note that an advantage of a sales and operations planning process isthat it requires performance measurement. By using measurements, such as RONA(return on net assets), a blood center can help blood centers avoid situations in which“the cost per unit (CPU) collected is higher than the sales cost of a unit to the health\\ncare provider or what an imported unit would cost.”\\nOne of the major challenges to applying the sales and operations planning process to\\nblood banks is data accuracy. The authors note that it is not uncommon to have datainconsistencies between the blood management system and the financial system.Without accurate and consistent data, the results of the sales and operations planningprocess would not be valid.\\nQuestion:\\n1. Write a memo to the director of a blood donation center in your geographic\\narea recommending the implementation of the sales and operations planningprocess to their blood banking system. Explain the benefits of such a system,and make sure that you identify and address arguments that might be madeagainst your proposal. Specifically address the issue of performance measuresin a nonprofit environment.\\nDisaggregating the Sales and Operations Plan in SAP ERP\\nAs mentioned previously, companies typically develop sales and operations plans for\\nproduct groups. Product groups are especially important for companies that havehundreds of products, because developing unique plans for hundreds of individual\\nproducts is extremely time consuming. Furthermore, it would be hard to develop that\\nmany different plans in a coordinated fashion while also taking in considerationproduction capacity. Fitter ’s product group is very simple; 70 percent of the group consists\\nof NRG-A bars, and 30 percent consists of NRG-B bars.\\nFigure 4-11 shows how product groups are defined in the SAP ERP system. The\\nsystem allows any number of products to be assigned to a product group. Product groups\\ncan have other product groups as members, as well, so complicated aggregations can be\\ndefined.93Production and Supply Chain Management Information Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Many other products,\\nhowever, are produced by joining component parts into subassemblies that are then joined\\nto form the finished product. It is obviously more complicated to calculate the rawmaterial requirements for products with more complex BOMs.\\nLead Times and Lot Sizing\\nThe BOM can be used to calculate how much of each raw material is required to produce\\na finished product. Determining the timing andquantity of purchase orders, however,\\nrequires information on lead times and lot sizing.\\nFor example, if a manufacturer orders a make-to-stock item, the lead time is the\\ncumulative time required for the supplier to receive and process the order, take the\\nmaterial out of stock, package it, load it on a truck, and deliver it to the manufacturer. The\\nmanufacturer might also include the time required to receive the material into itswarehouse (unloading the truck, inspecting the goods, and moving the goods into a storage\\nlocation).\\nLot sizing refers to the process of determining production quantities (for raw\\nmaterials produced in-house) and order quantities (for purchased items). In Fitter ’s case,\\nmany raw materials can only be ordered from a supplier in certain bulk quantities. For\\nexample, because Fitter uses large quantities of oats, the most cost-effective way topurchase oats is in bulk hopper-truck quantities, which means that the material must be\\nordered in 44,000-pound quantities. Wheat germ, however, is used in smaller quantities,\\nand to avoid having wheat germ become stale, Fitter orders it in 2,000-pound bulkcontainers. Protein powder is packaged in 50-pound bags that are loaded 25 to a pallet, so\\nthe most cost-effective way to order protein powder is by the pallet load (1,250 pounds).\\nLet’s look at the materials requirements planning process using oats, which have a\\ntwo-week lead time and must be ordered in hopper-truck quantities (multiples of 44,000pounds). To determine when and how many pounds of oats should be ordered, we will98Chapter 4\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

These NRG production quantities are\\nshown in terms of shipping cases. The first step is to convert the MPS from shipping cases\\nto 500-pound batches. Each shipping case weighs 72 pounds (not including packaging), soto convert shipping cases to 500-pound batches, multiply the number of shipping cases by\\n72 pounds per case, and then divide by 500 pounds per batch. Thus, producing 984\\nshipping cases of NRG-A bars in Week 1 of the year will require 142 batches, as shown inthe third row of Figure 4-17.\\nThe next row in Figure 4-17 is Gross requirements. The Gross requirements figures\\nare calculated by multiplying the MPS quantity (in production batches) by the pounds ofoats needed for a batch of snack bars. Fitter uses 300 pounds of oats per batch of NRG-A\\nbar and 250 pounds of oats per batch of NRG-B bar. This information is derived from the\\nBOM (Figure 4-16). Therefore, for Week 1, Fitter needs:\\n•NRG-A: 142 batches ×300 lb. per batch =42,600 lb. oats\\n•NRG-B: 61 batches ×250 lb. per batch =15,250 lb. oats\\n•Total =57,850 lb. oats\\nThe next row in Figure 4-17 is Scheduled receipts.

There is a two-week\\nlead time for oats, so for oats to be available in Week 1 and Week 2 of the year, oats orders\\nmust be placed in the last two weeks of the previous year.\\nThe next row, Planned receipts, shows when planned orders will arrive. The Planned\\nreceipts row is directly related to the Planned orders row at the bottom of the record.A planned order is one that has not been placed with the supplier but will need to be\\nplaced to prevent Production from running out of materials. Because there is a two-weeklead time for oat orders, the quantities in the planned orders row will be available for\\nproduction in two weeks, which is indicated by an entry in the Planned receipts row.\\nThe arrows in Figure 4-17 show the relationship between planned orders and planned\\nreceipts. For example, the materials requirements planning calculation suggests that anorder for 88,000 pounds of oats should be placed in Week 1 so it will arrive in Week 3. To\\nsay it differently: the planned order for 88,000 pounds of oats in Week 1 will not beavailable for use until Week 3, which is shown by the planned receipt of 88,000 pounds in\\nWeek 3. There is only one order, but it shows up in two places on the MRP record.\\nThe next row in Figure 4-17 is the On hand row. The first number in this row\\n(29,650) is the inventory of oats on hand at the beginning of Week 1. The On handnumber in the Week 1 column (15,800) is a projection of the inventory that will be on\\nhand at the end of Week 1 (and therefore at the beginning of Week 2)— accounting for the\\nbeginning inventory, gross requirements, and planned and scheduled receipts. In the case\\nof Week 1, the initial inventory of 29,650 pounds, plus the 44,000 pounds of scheduled\\nreceipts, minus the 57,850 gross requirement, leaves 15,800 pounds of oats available atthe start of Week 2.\\nThe last row is the Planned orders row. This is the quantity that the MRP calculation\\nrecommends ordering, and it is the output from the MRP process that purchasing uses todetermine what to order to produce the product, and when to order it.\\nMany times, a planner will need to intervene to tell the system to adjust the planned\\norder. For example, notice that the on-hand quantity of oats in Week 2 is only 1,950pounds. In the best case scenario, assume the line is producing the NRG-B bar (as that bar\\nuses less oats). At 250 pounds per batch, 1,950 pounds of oats would be enough oats for\\n7 full batches. The production line can produce 6 batches an hour, so 7 batches of doughwould only support the production line for 70 minutes. If the scheduled order does not\\narrive early enough on the first day of Week 2, the production line could be shut down.\\nWhen the purchase order scheduled to arrive in Week 1 was ready to be placed (twoweeks prior to the beginning of Week 1), the planner should have evaluated that order,\\nconsidering the low inventory level projected for the beginning of Week 2. The planner\\nmight have decided to place an order for two hopper-truck loads of oats, instead of theplanned order for one load. Or he could have ensured that the scheduled receipt shown in\\nWeek 2 would actually be delivered at the end of Week 1.\\nPlanning factors such as lead times are just estimates, so planners must evaluate the\\nplanned orders suggested by the materials requirements planning calculation beforeallowing the program to automatically turn them into purchase orders.100Chapter 4\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Of\\ncourse, a human being can do these computations, but with many products and\\nconstituent materials, the calculations become very tedious and prone to error. Even for\\na small company such as Fitter, doing the calculations with reasonable speed andaccuracy requires software help. Notice also the information needed to do the MRP\\ncalculation: starting with a sales forecast, the software works down to the master\\nproduction schedule and then to a schedule of required raw materials.\\nExercise 4.5\\nDevelop an MRP record, similar to the one in Figure 4-17, for wheat germ for the fiveweeks of January. Wheat germ must be ordered in bulk-container quantities, so the\\nplanned orders must be in multiples of 2,000 pounds. Use a lead time of one week and an\\ninitial on-hand inventory of 3,184 pounds; assume that an order of 8,000 pounds isscheduled for receipt during Week 1.

The MRP list shows the results of the MRP calculations,\\nwhile the Stock/Requirements List shows those results plus any changes that have\\noccurred since the MRP list was generated (planned orders converted to purchase ordersor production orders, material receipts, and so on). Because the materials requirements\\nplanning calculations are time consuming to process for a company producing hundreds of\\nproducts using thousands of parts, the materials requirements planning process is usuallyonly repeated every few days— or perhaps weekly. The Stock/Requirements List, however,\\nallows the users of the system to see what is happening (and what will happen) with amaterial in real time.\\nCompare the data shown in the MRP record in Figure 4-17 with the MRP list for oats\\nin Figure 4-18 and the Stock/Requirements List in Figure 4-19.101Production and Supply Chain Management Information Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

The evaluation scores for each vendor are updated automatically as\\nmaterials are received. The integrated information system allows Purchasing to make the\\nbest decision on a vendor based on relevant, up-to-date information.\\nOnce the Purchasing employee decides which vendor to use, the purchase order is\\ntransmitted to the vendor. The SAP ERP system can print out a paper order that can bemailed to the vendor. More likely, however, the system will be configured to either fax the\\norder to the vendor, transmit it electronically through EDI (electronic data interchange),or send it via email.\\nDetailed Scheduling\\nFinally, let ’s examine the last portion of the production process, detailed scheduling. The\\naggregate production plan for product groups developed in sales and operations planning isdisaggregated to individual products in finer time increments through the demandmanagement process. In detailed scheduling, a detailed plan of what is to be produced\\nneeds to be developed, considering machine capacity and available labor. Detailed\\nscheduling is complex and will not be presented here in spreadsheet form, but we willdiscuss the important concepts and issues.\\nA key decision in detailed production scheduling is determining how long the\\nproduction runs for each product should be. Longer production runs mean that fewermachine setups are required, reducing production costs and increasing the effective\\ncapacity of the equipment. On the other hand, shorter production runs can be used to\\nlower the inventory levels for finished products. Thus, the production run length requiresa balance between setup costs and holding costs to minimize total costs to the company.\\nBecause the capacity of the Fitter production mixers is much greater than that of the\\nsnack bar production line, scheduling mixer production is not an issue. Because the doughmust be mixed before the snack bar production line can start, employees who run the\\nmixers at Fitter begin working 30 minutes before the employees who run the production\\nline. During that time, four batches of dough can be mixed so they are ready when theproduction line starts. With a bit of a head start and a detailed schedule for the production\\nline, it is a simple matter for the personnel operating the mixers to keep ahead of the\\nproduction line. Thus, the key step for Fitter is to develop a detailed production schedulefor the snack bar production line.\\nThe manufacturing process that Fitter uses is known as repetitive manufacturing.\\nRepetitive manufacturing environments typically have production lines that are switched\\nfrom one product to another similar product. Most packaged consumer goods are produced\\nin repetitive manufacturing environments. In repetitive manufacturing, production lines\\nare scheduled for a period of time, rather than for a specific number of items, although itis possible to estimate the number of items that will be produced over a period of time.\\nFor Fitter, the production schedule for a week might be to produce NRG-A bars from\\nMonday morning until the end of day Wednesday, then change over to NRG-B bars for allof Thursday until Friday at noon, when the production line will be switched back to\\nNRG-A bars. Given this schedule, it is possible to estimate the number of bars that will be\\nproduced. Figure 4-22 shows the repetitive manufacturing planning screen in the SAPERP system.105Production and Supply Chain Management Information Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Between November 1 and November 8, NRG-A bars are\\nbeing produced for 3½ days, and NRG-B bars are being produced for 4½ days. The fourth\\nline of the bottom screen shows that a total of 1,050 cases of NRG-A snack bars will be\\nproduced from November 1 through November 4 (300 +300 +300 +150 =1,050), and\\nthen production will change over to NRG-B bars from November 4 through November 8\\n(this screen assumes production shifts continue through the weekend).\\nThe top section of the screen shows the production line capacity requirements for the plan\\nin the bottom section of the screen. The plan shown will require 90.090% of the availablecapacity of 8 hours per day for all days except November 4, when the capacity requirement will\\nbe 96.153%. The second line in the top section of the screen (Required-Repetitive Bakeline)shows the number of hours of capacity used by the plan (rounded to the nearest hour) while\\nthe third line (Available-Repetitive Bakeline) shows the planned capacity of the baking line.\\nIn some companies, responsibility for inventory costs belongs to a Materials\\nManagement group, and capacity utilization performance is the responsibility of aProduction group. Generally, the Materials Management group wants short production\\nruns to keep inventory levels down, while the Production group wants long productionruns to keep capacity utilization high. In these circumstances, the decision regarding\\nproduction run length can become a source of organizational bickering, instead of a\\ndecision that minimizes total costs for the benefit of the company.\\nThis conflict points out another advantage of production planning in an ERP system.\\nBecause the goal of the company is to maximize profit, the duration of production runsshould be decided by evaluating the cost of equipment setup and holding inventory. Anintegrated information system simplifies this analysis by automatically collecting106Chapter 4\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Accounting needs to know what Manufacturing has produced and what resources\\nwere used in producing those products, to determine which products, if any, are producing\\na profit —and then provide information for management to determine how to increase\\nprofits. In manufacturing plants, ERP systems do not directly connect with production\\nmachines. For example, in Fitter ’s case, SAP ERP could not directly read the number of\\nbars that came off the packing segment of the snack bar line. The data must be gathered in\\nsome way and then entered into SAP ERP for inventory accounting purposes.\\nData can be entered into SAP ERP through a PC on the shop floor, scanned using bar-\\ncode or RFID technology (discussed in more detail in Chapter 8), or entered using a mobiledevice. SAP ERP is an open-architecture system, meaning that it can work with automated\\ndata-collection tools marketed by third-party hardware and software companies.\\nIn an integrated ERP system, the accounting impact of a material transaction can be\\nrecorded automatically. For example, when a shipment of oats arrives at the Fitter plant,someone in the Receiving Department must verify the material and the quantity and quality\\nof the shipment before it is accepted. Once Fitter accepts the shipment, Receiving must notifythe SAP ERP system of the arrival and acceptance of the material. This communication is\\ndone by completing a goods receipt transaction, which is shown in Figure 4-23.\\nSource Line: SAP AG.\\nFIGURE 4-23 Goods Receipt screen in SAP ERP107Production and Supply Chain Management Information Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.The Receiving department must match the goods receipt with the purchase order that\\ninitiated it, to make sure the exact materials ordered have been received, so Accounting can\\npay the vendor. It is possible for the quantity of material entered in the goods receipt to differ\\nfrom the quantity specified on the purchase order. Depending on the configuration settings,the SAP ERP system might block entry of the receipt if the discrepancy is too large. If the\\ndiscrepancy is small, then the receipt may be allowed, with the difference posted to the\\ncorrect variance account, which allows the transaction to be processed but maintains arecord for management to review, to see if there is a consistent problem with a vendor over\\nshipping or “shorting ”an order (consistently shipping less than was ordered).\\nWhen the receipt is successfully recorded, the SAP ERP system immediately records\\nthe increase in inventory levels for the material. On the Accounting side of the system,this causes the value of the inventory shown in the general ledger account to automatically\\nincrease as well. This is an important feature of an integrated information system: thegoods receipt is recorded once, but the information is immediately available to both\\nManufacturing and Accounting —and the information is consistent. An integrated\\ninformation system also has the ability to adjust for changes in material costs. If the cost\\nof the material changes frequently, the system can be configured to reevaluate the value of\\nall the inventory of the material that the company has.\\nFor example, suppose Fitter has 10,000 pounds of cinnamon that it bought at $3 per\\npound. The company would value its inventory of cinnamon at $30,000. Then suppose theprice of cinnamon rises to $4 per pound, and Fitter purchases 1,000 pounds of cinnamon\\nat the higher price. What is the value of the 11,000 pounds of cinnamon that Fitter nowowns? The SAP ERP system can be configured to use a moving average formula to\\nreevaluate the inventory based on the current market prices. Depending on the exact\\nnature of the formula, the cinnamon would be valued at somewhere between the $3 perpound previously assumed and the $4 per pound that was just paid. The system can\\nperform this calculation automatically each time material is received.\\nUsing an ERP system to record data does not necessarily make the shop-floor\\naccounting data more accurate. The ERP system allows employees to enter data in realtime, but the system requires employees to follow the process. If employees can take\\nmaterial out of inventory without recording the transaction, then the real-time informationin the ERP system is worthless. Technologies such as bar-code scanners and RFID tags can\\nhelp in this process, but accurate data require both a capable information system and\\nproperly trained and motivated employees. However, when done accurately, capturingdata for manufacturing and inventory purposes on the shop floor means that it is captured\\nat the same time for accounting and inventory management purposes— eliminating any\\nneed to reconcile Accounting and Manufacturing records.\\nExercise 4.7\\nBriefly describe how the implementation of SAP ERP might change the relationship\\nbetween Production and Warehousing at Fitter.\\nERP AND SUPPLIERS\\nFitter is part of a supply chain that starts with farmers growing oats and wheat and endswith a customer buying an NRG bar from a retail store. Previously, companies usedcompetitive bidding to achieve low prices from suppliers, which frequently led to an108Chapter 4\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In recent years, more\\ncompanies have begun to realize that they are part of a supply chain, and if the supply\\nchain is more efficient, all participants in the chain can benefit. Collaboration can\\nfrequently achieve more than competition, and ERP systems can play a key role incollaborative planning.\\nWorking with suppliers in a collaborative fashion requires trust among all parties. A\\ncompany opens its records to its suppliers, and suppliers can read certain company databecause of common data formats. Working with suppliers in this way cuts down on\\npaperwork and response times. Reductions in paperwork, savings in time, and other\\nefficiency improvements translate into cost savings for the company and the suppliers.ERP lets companies and suppliers share information (sales, inventory, production plans,\\nand so on) in real time throughout the supply chain. This allows all parties to eliminate\\nfrom the supply chain costs that do not add value to the product (such as inventory,overtime, changeovers, and spoilage), while simultaneously improving customer service.\\nThe Traditional Supply Chain\\nThe term supply chain describes all the activities that occur between the growing or mining\\nof raw materials and the appearance of finished products on the store shelf. The supplychain for Fitter ’s NRG bars starts with farmers growing oats and wheat, and it ends with\\na customer buying a bar from a retail store. In a traditional supply chain, information is\\npassed through the supply chain reactively, as participants change their product orders—\\nas illustrated in Figure 4-24.\\nSource Line: Course Technology/Cengage Learning.\\nFIGURE 4-24 Supply chain—from raw materials to customer\\nFor example, a retailer sees an increase in the sales of Fitter ’s bars and orders a larger\\nquantity of bars from the wholesaler. If a number of retailers increase their orders, the\\nwholesaler will increase its orders from Fitter. When Fitter gets larger orders from\\nwholesalers, it must increase production to meet the increased demand. To increaseproduction, Fitter will order more raw materials from suppliers.\\nBecause of the time lags inherent in a traditional supply chain, it might take weeks —\\nor even months —for information about Fitter ’s increased need for raw materials to reach\\nFitter ’s suppliers. Raw material suppliers might require time to increase their production\\nto meet Fitter ’s larger orders, resulting in temporary shortages for the supplier. And\\nunusual events such as the “Oprah effect ”(where a product is endorsed by a famous name109Production and Supply Chain Management Information Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

For example, the\\nAmazon Kindle quickly sold out after the famous talk-show host Oprah Winfrey claimed it\\nwas one of her favorite items.\\nBy contrast, if the participants in the supply chain are part of an integrated process,\\ninformation about the increased customer demand can be passed quickly through thesupply chain, so each link in the chain can react quickly to the change.\\nEDI and ERP\\nThe development of supply chain strategies does not necessarily require an ERP system.\\nBefore ERP systems were available, companies could be linked with customers and\\nsuppliers through electronic data interchange (EDI) systems. Recall from Chapter 2 thatEDI is the computer-to-computer exchange of standard business documents (such as\\npurchase orders) between two companies. A well-developed ERP system, however, can\\nfacilitate supply chain management because the needed production planning andpurchasing systems are already in place. In addition, the integration of accounting data in\\nthe ERP system (described in the next chapter) allows management to evaluate changes in\\nthe market and make decisions about how those changes should affect the productionplan. With an ERP system, sharing production plans along the supply chain can occur in\\nreal time. Using the Internet can make this communication even faster and cheaper than\\nusing private EDI networks.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nComplexities of Supply Chain Management\\nOver the last few decades, a number of industry trends have focused on making supply\\nchains more efficient and effective. The first of these started in the 1980s whentechniques developed at the Toyota Motor Company, now commonly referred to as lean\\nmanufacturing , started to be accepted and copied by companies around the world. The\\nmain idea embodied in lean manufacturing —or the Toyota Production System (TPS) —is\\nthat waste must be eliminated. While that seems obvious, the TPS identified inventoryresulting from “overproduction ”as waste. Much of industrial practice, especially in the\\nUnited States, was focused on the idea that efficiency should be measured by havingeach machine produce to its maximum capacity. The TPS approach was that a company\\nshould produce exactly what is required when it is required. The TPS emphasized “pull”\\nsystems, where customer demand triggers production, rather than “push ”systems,\\nwhere planning methods like MRP are frequently used to push material through the\\nsupply chain to the customer in anticipation of demand.\\nA second important trend has been a decrease in vertical integration of companies.\\nVertical integration means the extent to which a company produces the components\\nand assemblies used in the products it manufactures. In the auto industry, verticalintegration reached its peak with Henry Ford and the River Rouge manufacturingcomplex, where iron ore was deposited at one end of the facility and finished cars rolledout the other. In the 1920s and 1930s, Ford owned iron ore mines and ore freighters,rubber plantations, and a host of businesses and industries that supplied its automobileassembly plants. The goal was to achieve high quality and low costs. Today, efficiency\\n(continued)110Chapter 4\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

According to Steve Rodgers, president of AMPA, the Canadian Auto Parts\\nManufacturers ’Association, “65 to 75 percent of the overall component cost of a car\\ncomes from outside suppliers. ”The auto manufacturers now focus on overall design of\\nthe vehicle and allow the suppliers to develop the expertise in the braking systems,\\ninteriors, and so on, which are then plugged into the designs.\\nA third trend is supply base rationalization, an effort to determine the “appropriate ”\\nnumber of suppliers a company should have. Many large firms have thousands ofsuppliers. However, the rationalization concept says that better supplier relationshipscan be developed when there are fewer suppliers to manage, and costs will be reducedwhen a smaller number of suppliers have higher production volumes. In 2008, Ford ’s\\nSenior Vice President of Global Purchasing announced that Ford would be reducing itssupply base from over 2,000 suppliers to 700 to 800 over a period of years.\\nThese trends —lean manufacturing, reduced vertical integration, and supply base\\nrationalization —have been implemented by manufacturers in a number of industries\\nover the past 30 years and have resulted in higher efficiencies and reduced cost. Butthese savings have not come without a cost: increased exposure to disruption. Thisincreased risk was highlighted by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan on March 14,2011. In addition to the tragic loss of human life and destruction of property, thedisaster forced many global companies to severely reduce or shut down production.Japanese-based companies such as Toyota were obviously affected, but the integratednature of global supply chains meant that the effect of the earthquake rippledthroughout the world. For example, the three largest shipbuilders in the world arelocated in Korea and are dependent on Japanese steel, and the Japanese steel industrywas significantly impacted by the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster, which wastriggered by the tsunami that followed the earthquake. (The explosions, fire, and coremeltdowns at the power plant made it the worst nuclear disaster since the 1986Chernobyl explosion.)\\nToyota, which has led many of these supply chain trends, is now planning to lead\\nthe way in reducing supply chain risk. In September 2011, they announced plans tocreate a robust supply chain that would recover within two weeks in the event ofanother massive disruption. This plan consists of three fundamental steps. First, Toyotaintends to push for further standardization of parts across Japanese automakers so theycan share common components, which could, in turn, be manufactured in severallocations. The second element in the plan is the development of technology that would\\nprovide more options for parts that require unique materials or components that are\\nonly available from one source. Finally, Toyota plans to make each region in the worldindependent in its parts procurement so that a disaster in Japan would not affectproduction overseas.\\nSupply chains have always been complex, but now in addition to speed and\\nefficiency, flexibility and risk reduction must be considered priorities.\\nQuestion:\\n1. What are other potential causes of supply chain disruption? How can ERP\\nsystems help minimize the impact when disruptions occur?111Production and Supply Chain Management Information Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

One measure is called the cash-to-\\ncash cycle time . This term refers to the time between paying for raw materials and\\ncollecting cash from the customer. In one study, the cash-to-cash cycle time for\\ncompanies with efficient supply chain management processes was a month, whereas the\\ncycle averaged 100 days for those companies without effective supply chain management.\\nAnother metric is total supply chain management costs. These costs include the cost\\nof buying and handling inventory, processing orders, and supporting a company ’s\\ninformation systems. In one study, companies with efficient supply chain management\\nprocesses incurred costs equal to 5 percent of sales. By contrast, companies withoutsupply chain management incurred costs of up to 12 percent of sales.\\nOther metrics have been developed to measure what is happening between a company\\nand its suppliers. For example, Staples, the office-supply company, measures three facetsof the relationship. Initial fill rate is the percentage of an order that the supplier provided\\nin the first shipment. Another metric is initial order lead time , which is the time needed\\nfor the supplier to fill the order. Finally, Staples measures on-time performance . This\\nmeasurement tracks how often the supplier met agreed-upon delivery dates.\\nImprovements in metrics such as these lead to improvements in overall supply chain\\ncost measurements.\\nExercise 4.8\\nAssume a manufacturer of residential lawn and garden equipment is considering investingin hardware and software that will improve linkages with suppliers.

The company’ s annual sales are\\n$1 billion. The company ’s chief financial officer insists that the investment must pay for\\nitself in cost savings in three years. To meet this requirement, how much should the chiefinformation officer be allowed to spend on improving the supply chain? Explain youranswer.112Chapter 4\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

As it did with\\npromoting EDI and RFIDs in the early stages of those technologies, Walmart is leading\\nthe curve with its sustainability efforts. In 2008, Walmart ’s CEO, Lee Scott, told a large\\ngathering in China, “A company that cheats on overtime and on the age of its labor, that\\ndumps its scraps and chemicals into our rivers, that does not pay its taxes or honor its\\ncontracts —will ultimately cheat on the quality of its products. And cheating on the\\nquality of products is the same as cheating on customers. We will not tolerate that atWalmart. ”\\nAs part of this initiative, Walmart will survey its 100,000 global suppliers and\\nultimately create a “sustainability product index,” which will allow the company to\\nevaluate suppliers on their sustainability efforts. Suppliers anxious to keep Walmart as acustomer will be motivated to improve their rating on the sustainability index. Someexperts think Walmart can change the business climate on sustainability. According toHarvard Professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Walmart ’s determination to use its\\nconsiderable influence to raise the standards for environmental sustainability “shows\\nthat a single company using its unique clout can accelerate public action to reducegreenhouse gases and reverse climate change. ”\\nWalmart ’s new initiative translates into a new burden on suppliers. By some\\nestimates, the company ’s efforts to improve sustainability could increase the cost of\\nproducts by 1 –3 percent, due, in part, to new requirements that suppliers label products\\nwith a green index. However, these costs may be offset if the suppliers, as part of theirefforts to reduce their impact on the environment, can also improve their supply chainefficiency.\\nQuestion:\\n1. Do you think consumers will be willing to pay increased prices to ensure their\\nproducts are sustainably produced and packaged? Would you be willing to paythe extra cost?

An additional area of accounting, tax accounting, is beyond the\\nscope of this text. Because tax accounting is chiefly the external reporting of a business ’s\\nactivities to the Internal Revenue Service, data gathered for financial accounting serves as\\nthe basis for tax accounting.\\nFinancial accounting consists of documenting all the transactions of a company that\\nhave an impact on the financial state of the organization and then using those documentedtransactions to create reports for investors and external parties and agencies. These reports,\\ntypically called financial statements , must follow the prescribed rules and guidelines of\\nvarious agencies, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the U.S.\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\\nCommon financial statements include balance sheets and income statements. The\\nbalance sheet is a summary of account balances such as cash held; amounts owed to the\\ncompany by customers; the cost of raw materials and finished-goods inventories; the value of\\nfixed assets such as buildings; amounts owed to vendors, banks, and other creditors; andamounts that the investors have invested in the company. A balance sheet provides an\\noverview of a company ’s financial health at a point in time, a key consideration for a\\ncompany ’s creditors and investors.

Profitability is important to creditors and investors. It is also important information\\nfor managers in charge of day-to-day operations. In general, a manager views profits asindicators of success and losses as indicators of problems to be solved. Figure 5-2 shows a\\nsample income statement for Fitter.\\nFitter Snacker Income Statement\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2011\\n(in thousands of dollars) \\n1 9 6 , 5 2 $ e s n e p x e  d l o s  s d o o g  f o  t s o C\\n1 5 2 , 4 $ e s n e p x e  e v i t a r t s i n i m d a  d n a  , l a r e n e g  , g n i l l e S\\n2 6 9 $ e s n e p x e  t n e m p o l e v e d  d n a  h c r a e s e RTotal revenue $36,002\\nExpensesSales revenueRevenue\\nPretax income $4,577\\nIncome tax expense $1,144\\nNet income $3,433Total expenses $31,425Interest expense$36,002\\n$521\\nSource Line: Course Technology/Cengage Learning.\\nFIGURE 5-2 Sample income statement for Fitter\\nTypically, companies prepare financial statements quarterly, sometimes more\\nfrequently. To prepare these statements, a company must “close its books, ”which means\\nthat balances for temporary or nominal accounts (such as revenue, expense, gain, and\\nloss) are transferred to the retained earnings account. The closed nominal accounts willhave a zero balance from which to start accumulating revenue and expenses in the next\\nreporting period. Closing entries are made to transfer the balances and establish zero\\nbalances for the nominal accounts. To do this, employees must check the accounts toensure they are accurate and up to date. If a company’ s information systems routinely\\ngenerate accurate and timely data, closing the books can go smoothly. If not, “adjusting ”\\nentries must be made, in which case, closing the books can be a very time-consumingchore with inaccurate results.119Accounting in ERP Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Another feature of the ERPbalance sheet and P&L statement is the ability to quickly display data at different levels of\\ndetail, as shown in Figure 5-4. In addition, an ERP system allows the user to create\\nfinancial statement variants, which are financial statements in other formats, prepared tosuit the needs of different users.120Chapter 5\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

While the high-level information that appears in a company ’s\\nbalance sheet and income statement shows whether a firm is making an overall profit,\\nthe goal of managerial accounting is to provide managers with detailed information formaking informed decisions, creating budgets, determining the profitability of a particular\\nproduct, sales region, or marketing campaign, and so on. Managerial accounting produces\\ninformation that managers use to control a company ’s day-to-day activities and to develop\\nlong-term plans for operations, marketing, personnel needs, repayment of debt, and other\\nmanagement issues. Because managerial accounting provides reports and analyses for\\ninternal use, companies can be flexible in how they configure their managerial accountingsystems.\\nUsing ERP for Accounting Information\\nRecall from Chapter 1, that in the past, most companies had separate functional\\ninformation systems: a marketing information system, a manufacturing information\\nsystem, and so on —each with its own way of gathering data and its own file system for\\nrecording data. Since the 1960s, legions of accountants, analysts, and programmers have\\ntried, often unsuccessfully, to make unintegrated systems work, as prior chapters\\nillustrate. Companies built these unintegrated systems primarily to handle the needs of theindividual functional areas, and secondarily to provide data to Accounting so that121Accounting in ERP Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Further, because the shared data were often not the only information that\\nAccounting needed to prepare reports for management, accountants and functional areaclerks usually had to spend considerable time doing additional research to create those\\nreports.\\nAn ERP system, with its centralized database, avoids these problems. For example,\\nsuppose finished goods are transferred from the assembly line to the warehouse. Anemployee in the warehouse can easily record the transaction, using a terminal or a bar-\\ncode scanner. In SAP ERP, the Materials Management module would see the transfer eventas an increase in finished goods inventory available for shipment; the Accounting module\\nwould see the event as an increase in the monetary value of the finished goods inventory.\\nWith ERP, everyone uses the same database to record operating data. This database isthen used to generate management reports, produce financial statements, and create\\nbudgets.\\nIn accounting, a company ’s accounts are kept in a record called the general ledger .I n\\nthe SAP ERP system, input to the general ledger occurs simultaneously with the businesstransaction in the specific module. Many SAP ERP modules cause transaction data to be\\nentered into the general ledger, including:\\n\\x81Sales and Distribution (SD) —The SD module records a sale and then creates\\nanaccounts receivable entry (a general ledger document that indicates a\\ncustomer owes money for the goods received by the customer).\\n\\x81Materials Management (MM) —The MM module controls purchasing and\\nrecords inventory changes. The receipt of goods from a purchase ordercreates an accounts payable entry in the general ledger, which indicates the\\ncompany has an obligation to pay for goods it has received. Whenever\\nmaterial moves into or out of inventory (purchased materials arrive from the\\nvendor, raw materials are taken out of inventory to support production, orfinished goods go from production to inventory), general ledger accounts are\\naffected.\\n\\x81Financial Accounting (FI) —The FI module manages the accounts receivable\\nand accounts payable items created in the SD and MM modules, respectively.The FI module is also where the general ledger accounts are closed at the\\nend of a fiscal period (quarter or year), and it is used to generate financialstatements.\\n\\x81Controlling (CO)— The CO module tracks the costs associated with\\nproducing products. To make a profit, a company must have an accuratepicture of its product costs so it can make correct decisions about product\\npricing and promotions, as well as capital investments.\\n\\x81Human Resources (HR) —The HR module manages the recruiting, hiring,\\ncompensation, termination, and severance of employees; the HR module alsomanages benefits and generates the payroll.\\n\\x81Asset Management (AM) —The AM module manages fixed-asset purchases\\n(plant and machinery) and the related depreciation.122Chapter 5\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

In this\\nsection, we will look at industrial credit granting in general, and then we will examine the\\nproblems with Fitter ’s credit-granting procedures in more detail.\\nIndustrial Credit Management\\nCompanies routinely sell to customers on credit; however, good financial management\\nrequires that only so much credit be extended to a customer. At some point, the customermust pay off some of the debt to justify the faith the seller has shown (and so the seller\\ncan turn the accounts receivables into cash). Credit management requires a balance\\nbetween granting sufficient credit to support sales and ensuring the company does not losetoo much money by granting credit to customers who end up defaulting on their credit\\nobligations.\\nIn practice, sellers manage this relationship by setting a limit on how much money a\\ncustomer can owe at any one time, and then monitoring that limit as new orders come in andpayments are received. For example, the seller might tell a buyer that her credit limit is\\n$10,000, which means that the most she can owe the seller is $10,000. If the buyer reachesthat amount, the seller will accept no further sales orders until she pays off some of her debt.\\nWhen making a sale on credit, the seller makes an entry on the books to increase the\\naccounts receivable and sales balances. Thus, when the buyer’ s accounts receivable balance\\non the seller ’s books reaches $10,000, the buyer must make some payment.\\nContinuing the example, assume the buyer calls the seller to order $3,000 ’s worth of\\ngoods. If the buyer’ s accounts receivable balance is already $8,000, the seller should not\\naccept the $3,000 order because it would bring the accounts receivable balance to\\n$11,000, which exceeds the buyer’ s credit limit. Instead of refusing the order, the seller ’s\\nsales representative might suggest that the buyer reduce the size of the order, or ask her\\nto send in a payment before processing the order, thus reducing the buyer ’s debt. Clearly,\\nto make this system work, a sales representative needs to have access to up-to-dateaccounts receivable balances for all customers.\\nIf Accounting keeps the books up to date and can provide the current accounts\\nreceivable balance to Marketing and Sales when needed , then credit limits can be properly\\nmanaged. Marketing and Sales can compare the customer ’s credit limit to an accurate\\nbalance-owed amount (plus the order ’s value) to make a decision. However, in an\\nunintegrated system, Accounting may not immediately record sales and/or paymentreceipts as they occur. In that case, accounts receivable balances will not be current.Furthermore, the sales representative may be working from an out-of-date credit-balance\\nprintout. If the printout does not reflect recent payments, a customer may be improperly\\ndenied credit. The customer would probably challenge the denial, which would trigger arequest for updated information in Accounting. The delay entailed in that research could\\nreduce customer satisfaction, and performing the research would consume valuable\\nemployee time.123Accounting in ERP Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

When a sale\\nis made, the system immediately increases the customer ’s accounts receivable balance.\\nWhen the company receives and records a payment, the accounts receivable balance is\\nimmediately decreased. Because the underlying database is available to Accounting and\\nMarketing and Sales, sales representatives have access to up-to-date customer balance\\ninformation. Thus, sales representatives do not need to make a request to Accounting for\\nthe customer ’s accounts receivable balance.\\nWith that background, we can now consider how Fitter handles credit management,\\nusing unintegrated systems.\\nFitter ’s Credit Management Procedures\\nAs described in Chapter 3, when a new order comes in to Fitter, a sales clerk refers to aweekly printout of a customer ’s current balance and credit limit to see if credit should be\\ngranted. Assuming the customer ’s order would not present credit-limit problems, the sales\\nclerk enters the sale in the sales order entry system, which is a stand-alone computerprogram. Sales data are transferred to Accounting by transferring files at the end of eachday. An accounting clerk uses the data transferred from the sales system to prepare\\ncustomer invoices.\\nAccounting must make adjustments for any partial shipments before creating an\\ninvoice. The accuracy of the adjustment process depends on whether the warehousetransmits order changes to Accounting in a timely fashion. After creating the invoice,\\nAccounting makes the standard revenue-recognition accounting entries: a debit toaccounts receivable and a credit to sales for the amount billed.\\nAccounting clerks also process customer payments. Clerks receive and manually\\nhandle checks. They enter data in the accounting program, increasing the cash balanceand decreasing the accounts receivable balance.

If time permits, accounts are posted (and the bank deposit is made) on the daypayment is received; otherwise, the entries are done as soon as possible the next day.\\nThus, there can be a delay between the time Fitter receives a check from a customer and\\nthe actual reduction of the customer ’s accounts receivable balance, which can lead to\\nmistakes in credit management.\\nNow let ’s look at how SAP ERP could improve Fitter ’s credit management process.\\nCredit Management in SAP ERP\\nThe SAP ERP system allows a company to set a credit limit for each customer. A companycan configure any number of credit-check options in the SAP ERP system, including whento check a customer ’s credit (for instance, at order creation, at creation of the delivery\\ndocument, or at the goods issue) and who to notify when an order would cause a customerto exceed its credit limit (for instance, the sales clerk or credit management personnel).Figure 5-5 shows a dynamic credit check with Reaction C selected.\\nReaction C means that if the order being saved will cause the customer to exceed its\\ncredit limit, the system will issue a warning indicating the amount by which the orderexceeds the credit limit. Because the system is issuing a warning, the order can be saved,\\nbut it will be blocked from further processing until the credit problem is cleared.124Chapter 5\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

When data are inaccurate or incomplete, the analyses are flawed. There are\\nthree main reasons for inaccurate or incomplete data: inconsistent record keeping,\\ninaccurate inventory costing systems, and problems consolidating data from subsidiaries.The following sections will look at each of these causes, using Fitter as an example.\\nInconsistent Record Keeping\\nEach of Fitter ’s sales divisions maintains its own records and tracks sales data differently.\\nThe Direct Sales Division ’s sales order form includes a code for the appropriate sales\\nregion (Northeast, Southeast, and so on). The Wholesale Division ’s sales order form\\nincludes a code for the state. Suppose that a Fitter executive asks for a report that\\nsummarizes monthly sales dollars for all Mid-Atlantic states (i.e., some states from Fitter ’s\\nNortheast sales region and some states from its Southeast region) for each month of the\\nprevious year. Neither division’ s records are set up to easily answer that question. Rather,\\na Fitter accountant would need to go to the source sales documents for the Direct SalesDivision and, by looking at the shipping address, determine whether the sale was to acompany in a Mid-Atlantic state. If so, the accountant would need to manually add the\\nrelevant information for this sale to an electronic spreadsheet. For the Wholesale Division,\\nthe accountant could run sales summary reports for each state in the Mid-Atlantic regionby month and add this data manually to the spreadsheet report. Once all the data was\\ngathered, it could be formatted to create the desired reports.\\nNow, suppose Fitter ’s management wants to evaluate the efficiency of Production ’s\\noperations. Production uses paper records, so, again, data must be taken from the paperrecords and entered into a spreadsheet. As often happens, those paper records might be\\ninaccurate or missing, making the validity of the final report questionable and the creationof the report time consuming.\\nThere are many variations on this theme. Conceivably, a company ’s divisions could\\nmaintain the same data about a function, but if each division’ s system was created at a\\ndifferent time, each might a different file system. Often, to answer a question about overall\\ncompany performance, at least one set of data must be rekeyed into a spreadsheet\\n(or some other middleware program) for the merged analysis. While it is possible to get ananswer, doing so takes much more time with unintegrated systems.\\nWith an ERP system, this sort of effort is minimized or eliminated because both\\ndivisions record and store their data in the same way, in the same database. Ideally, thecompany ’s processes would be changed to fit the best practices of the software when it is\\ninstalled.

Managers need to know how much it costs to make\\nindividual products, so they can identify which products are profitable and which are not.\\nIn the next section, we will first review the fundamentals of inventory cost accounting.\\nThen, we will explore how an ERP system can improve the accuracy of inventory costaccounting. Finally, we will discuss the rationale behind activity-based costing as a method\\nto further improve the accuracy of inventory cost accounting.\\nInventory Cost Accounting Background\\nA manufactured item’ s cost has three elements: (1) the cost of raw materials, (2) the cost\\nof labor employed directly in the production of the item, and (3) all other costs, which are\\ntypically called overhead . Manufacturing overhead costs include factory utilities, general\\nfactory labor (such as custodians or security guards), factory managers ’salaries, storage,\\ninsurance, and other manufacturing-related costs.\\nMaterials and labor are often called direct costs because the constituent amounts of\\neach in a finished product can be estimated fairly accurately. On the other hand, theoverhead items are indirect costs , which are difficult to associate with a specific product\\nor a batch of specific products. In other words, the direct cause-and-effect relationship\\nbetween an overhead cost (such as the cost of heat and light) and making a particular\\nproduct (NRG-A bars) is difficult to establish.\\nNevertheless, overhead costs are part of making products, so companies must have\\nsome way to allocate these indirect costs to the products they make. A common method isto use total machine hours, on the assumption that overhead is incurred to run themachines that make the products. With this approach, overhead costs for a certain time\\nperiod are added up and then divided by the expected total machine hours for that time\\nperiod to get an overhead per machine hour rate. This value is then used to allocateoverhead costs to products. Suppose Fitter used this approach and calculated its overhead\\nrate at $1,000 per machine hour. If Fitter can make 10,000 bars in an hour, then each bar\\nwould be allocated $0.10 of overhead ($1,000 ÷ 10,000). Overhead can also be allocated toa product using direct labor hours or material costs. A company makes the decision on\\nhow to allocate overhead costs based on what makes the most sense in its production\\nenvironment.\\nCompanies such as Fitter that produce goods for inventory typically record the cost of\\nmanufacturing during a period using a standard cost. As explained in Chapter 4, standardcosts for a product are established by studying historical direct and indirect cost patternsin a company and taking into account the effects of current manufacturing changes. At the\\nend of an accounting period, if actual costs differ from standard costs, adjustments to the\\naccounts must be made to show the actual cost of inventory owned on the balance sheetand the cost of inventory sold on the income statement.\\nFor example, Fitter might determine that each NRG-A bar should cost $0.75 to\\nmake —that is, the cost of raw materials, labor, and overhead should equal $0.75 per bar,128Chapter 5\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

That amount would be Fitter ’s standard cost for a bar.\\nAssume that during a given month, Fitter makes 1 million NRG-A bars. Using the standard\\ncost, it would increase its balance sheet inventory account by $750,000. Also, assume that\\nthe company sells 800,000 bars in the month. In the income statement, the cost of thesales would be shown as $600,000 (800,000 × $0.75). The inventory account would be\\nreduced by $600,000, because the company no longer has those units to sell.\\nIf actual costs in the month equaled standard costs, no balance sheet or income\\nstatement adjustments would be needed. Actual costs never exactly equal expected costs,however, so adjustments are almost always needed. The differences between actual costs\\nand standard costs are called cost variances . Note that cost variances can arise with both\\ndirect and indirect costs. These variances are calculated by comparing actual expenses for\\nmaterial, labor, utilities, rent, and so on, with predicted standard costs.\\nIf the company keeps records for the various elements separately, compiling variance\\nadjustments can be difficult. If products are made by assembling parts that are made atdifferent manufacturing sites, and the sites use different information systems, the\\nadjustments may be very imprecise.\\nERP and Inventory Cost Accounting\\nMany companies with unintegrated accounting systems analyze their cost variances\\ninfrequently because of the difficulty of doing so. As a result, these companies often do notknow how much it actually costs to produce a unit of a product. As the following example\\nillustrates, knowing precisely how much production costs can be very important.\\nSuppose Fitter has an opportunity to sell 300,000 NRG-A bars to a new customer. This\\nis a huge order for Fitter. The customer wants a price of $0.90 per bar. Fitter ’s standard\\ncost per bar is currently $0.75— based on information that is two months old. Fitter knows\\nthat the costs to manufacture snack bars have been increasing significantly in the past few\\nmonths. Fitter does not want to sell at a loss per unit, but it also does not want to lose a\\nlarge order or a potentially good long-term customer. Because of the difficulty of compiling\\nall the data to calculate cost variances, Fitter only analyzes cost variances quarterly, andnew data will not be available for another month. Should Fitter accept the large order?\\nIf Fitter had an ERP system, employees throughout the company would have recorded\\ncosts in the company-wide database as they occurred. The methods for allocating costs toproducts and for computing variances would have been built into the system when it was\\nconfigured. Thus, the system could compute variances automatically when needed. This\\nwould simplify the process of adjusting accounts, and Fitter ’s management would always\\nhave accurate, up-to-date information on cost variances. Fitter could make an informed\\ndecision on whether it could profitably sell snack bars for $0.90 each. Furthermore, with a\\nproperly operating sales and operations planning process, Fitter could determine whetherit has the capacity to complete the order on time, as well. If overtime would be required to\\ncomplete the order, then analysts could use the planning capabilities of the ERP system\\nto evaluate costs using overtime production.\\nERP system configurations allow analysts to track costs using many bases —by job, by\\nwork area, or by production activity. This means that unit costs can be computed usingdifferent overhead allocation bases, allowing an analyst to play “what if ”with product\\nprofitability decisions. In an unintegrated system, doing such multifaceted tracking would\\nbe time consuming and difficult.129Accounting in ERP Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Currently, Fitter uses a rate of 30 percent of the cost of goodsmanufactured to estimate the sales and administrative costs. Adding the sales and\\nadministrative costs to the COGM gives the cost of goods sold (COGS). Because the COGMand COGS were estimated based on the BOM (recipe) from Chapter 4 that produces seven\\ncases of snack bars, the figures must be divided by seven to give the COGM and COGS on\\na per-case basis.

In activity-based\\ncosting, overhead costs are assigned to products based on the manufacturing activities that\\ngave rise to the costs. Accountants identify activities associated with overhead costgeneration, and they keep records on the costs and on the activities. The activities\\nare viewed as causes (drivers) of the overhead costs. This view treats overhead costs asmore direct than traditional cost-accounting methods have treated them. In an attempt toassign costs more precisely to individual products, activity-based costing tries to avoid132Chapter 5\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Although not all overhead costs can be linked to products by\\ntheir activities, many can be. Activity-based costing is often used when competition is stiff,\\noverhead costs are high, and products are diverse. A company using activity-based costing\\ncan determine which products have the highest profit margin, information that is crucialfor making strategic decisions on product lines.\\nConsider this example from Fitter ’s operations. Suppose that storage of raw materials\\nis considered an activity. Also assume that storage activities differ between NRG-A andNRG-B bars because the ingredients are different, and that some of these storage activities\\nare more labor-intensive than others. In an ERP system, Fitter would track the various\\nstorage activities (how often they occur) and the cost of each. When determining theprofitability of each kind of bar, Fitter cost accountants calculate storage costs based on\\nthe number of storage activities required by each type of bar. This costing is more precise\\nthan computing an average storage cost based on total storage costs and machine hours,and then allocating that amount to each kind of bar. Conceivably, if the activities differ\\nenough from one bar to the next, one could be significantly more or less profitable than\\nthe other. This fact would be revealed by the activity-based costing approach, but notby\\ntraditional cost-accounting approaches .An information system that supports activity-\\nbased costing allows managers to see that difference.\\nActivity-based costing requires more bookkeeping than traditional costing methods\\nbecause a company must do activity-based costing in addition to traditional costing, and\\nbecause activity-based costing requires a company to keep track of instances of activities,\\nnot just the costs. For many companies, the cost and effort required to implement activity-based costing is justified by the value of the information yielded. Companies often use\\nactivity-based costing for strategic purposes, while using traditional costing for\\nbookkeeping and taxes. Having an integrated information system allows a company to doboth kinds of accounting much more easily. One study of companies with and without\\nERP revealed that: (1) ERP companies had nearly twice as many cost-allocation bases to\\nuse in management decision making, and (2) the ERP companies ’managers rated their\\ncost-accounting system much higher. ERP companies also have more faith in the numbers\\nfrom their accounting systems.\\nA survey of management accountants revealed some interesting findings in regard to\\nhow they perceived their ERP systems. Researchers conducting this survey solicitedresponses from approximately 500 members of the IMA, the association for accountants\\nand financial professionals in business. ERP systems were looked at by accountingmanagers as being better than not having ERP systems in the areas of having the attributes\\nof a “single, comprehensive database, providing data on a real-time basis, and making\\nrelevant information available to operations management. ”In addition, ERP systems were\\nfound to help in resolving conflicts in goals, standardizing basic processes, and controllingproduct costs. ERP systems in the accounting field also help shorten the time for making\\ndecisions and improve that decision making. On the negative side, the respondentsthought the ERP systems were overly complex and took too long to implement.\\nProblems Consolidating Data from Subsidiaries\\nSome companies have special operations that make closing their books at the end of an\\naccounting period a challenge. Companies that have subsidiaries or branches face such a\\nchallenge, and most large companies have more than one legal entity.

Assume one euro is worth $1.25 (US), and a company ’s European\\nsubsidiary reports cash of 1 million euros at the end of the year. When the European\\nsubsidiary ’s balances are consolidated with those of the U.S. parent company at the end of\\nthe year, $1,250,000 will be recorded.

From the point of view of an\\noutsider, money has merely passed from one part of the consolidated company to another.\\nA company cannot make a profit by selling to itself.\\nCompanies often do business with their subsidiaries, and for such companies,\\nintercompany transactions occur frequently. Keeping track of those transactions andmaking the adjustments can be a challenge for accountants.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nSpreadsheets: A Poor Substitute\\nMany users of information technology feel comfortable using spreadsheets such as Excel\\nto do large data analysis and reporting projects. And, as Nick Gomersall (a specialist in\\nERP and accounting systems at The GL Company) notes, it is easy to form a linkbetween a company ’s ERP system and a personal computer through which an end user\\ncan download ERP transaction data into a spreadsheet. These spreadsheets are oftenused for data analysis and reporting instead of the built-in reporting functionality of theERP system or its Business Intelligence (BI) tools because these reporting tools are newand sometimes challenging to learn. These “rogue ”spreadsheets can create considerable\\nrisk for a company in terms of lack of consistency, reliability, and control.

In addition, financial spreadsheets\\non laptops taken outside the company create a risk for loss of sensitive data.\\nGomersall advocates that companies use “accounting intelligence ”applications,\\nwhich use real-time processing rather than batch processing to pull data from ERP\\nsystems and which include built-in reporting templates that can be used to gain insightinto the corporate earnings. However, these applications are not always available, orfully utilized, and many companies are not aware of the extent of “rogue ”spreadsheet\\nuse. According to an analyst with Gartner Research, most companies’ IT organizations\\ndo not provide technical support for Excel, and are often “unaware of the extent to\\nwhich sophisticated and complex spreadsheets are being used within the enterprise.Unless explicitly directed by a compliance officer to exert more control over spreadsheetusage, most IT managers avoid intruding too deeply into the area of user-developedapplications. ”\\nMost CFOs (chief financial officers) are unaware of the extent to which spreadsheets\\nand manual data analysis are involved in closing a company ’s books. In fact, the area of\\nclosing the books and reconciliation are two tangible areas where Accounting canimprove its timing and accuracy by taking full advantage of the capabilities of acompany ’s ERP system.\\nQuestion:\\n1. Make a list of the pros and cons of using spreadsheets for financial analysis\\nwithin a corporation. Alternatively, form two teams in the classroom anddebate the pros and cons.\\nMANAGEMENT REPORTING WITH ERP SYSTEMS\\nThe integrated nature of an ERP system and the use of a common database and built-in\\nmanagement reporting provide numerous benefits. Although the reporting of accounting\\ninformation is a common Accounting function, it is often very challenging for companiesto generate the right reports for the right situation. Without an ERP system, the job of\\ntracking all the data required for a financial report is a monumental undertaking. With an\\nERP system, a vast amount of information is available for reporting purposes; however,often it is years after an ERP implementation before a company figures out which reports\\nare the most critical for decision making. In this section, we will examine some\\nmanagement-reporting and analysis tools available with ERP systems.\\nData Flows in ERP Systems\\nAs you have seen in earlier chapters, with an ERP system, all transactions in all functionalareas of a company are posted in a centralized database. It is worth reemphasizing that\\nthe database isthe company ’s“books.” There is no separate set of books for Marketing\\nand Sales or Production or Purchasing.\\nThus, even though it is common usage to refer to “data flows ”in an ERP system, it is\\nactually a misnomer. Data do not flow from one ERP module to another because they are\\nall in one place— the database. Each area views the same records. It might be better to136Chapter 5\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

If you need to look up a\\ntransaction in SAP ERP, you do so by referencing the document number, which acts as anindex to the appropriate database table entries.\\nIn SAP ERP, document numbers for related transactions are associated in the\\ndatabase. This provides an electronic audit trail for analysts trying to determine the statusof an order. The best example of this concept is the linkage of document numbers for a\\nsales order. Figure 5-10 illustrates the document flow concept for a sales transaction.\\nSource Line: SAP AG.\\nFIGURE 5-10 Document flow of a sales transaction in SAP ERP\\nThe linked events shown in Figure 5-10 progress as follows:\\n1. When the order was placed, sales order document 120 was created.\\n2. The system recorded the delivery, which is the transfer of the order ’s\\nrequirements to the Materials Management module; the delivery is denoted\\nby document 80000060.\\n3. The picking request, which is the document that tells warehouse personnel\\nwhich items make up the order, was created and given document number\\n20120108.\\n4. The goods were removed from inventory on the same day, an event recorded\\nby document number 4900000171.137Accounting in ERP Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

After the goods were issued, an invoice was generated so the customer would\\nbe billed; the invoice was given document number 90000048.\\n6. At the same time, the accounting entries for the sale were generated. The\\nposting document number is 90000000.\\nThe Document Flow screen can be used to drill down to see the details of any one of\\nthese events. The term drill down refers to the ability to view the details behind a summary\\nof information. For example, the user can double-click the order number (120) and see the\\ndetails of the order —products ordered, quantity, customer name, and so on. From that\\ndisplay, the user can double-click the product numbers or the customer number for more\\ndetails on the products or customer. To see the debits and credits in the accounting entry,\\nthe user can double-click the accounting document to see the scheduled entries.\\nUsers can access the document flow from any SAP screen that is used in the sales\\norder process. If a customer were to call and ask about the status of an order, the salesrepresentative could access the document flow and see whether the goods had been\\nshipped. If the customer called with questions about an invoice, the representative coulduse the document flow to access the documents related to that invoice, such as the\\noriginal sales order or the picking request. This sort of research can be done quickly with\\nSAP ERP. With unintegrated systems, establishing the audit trail and researching sourcedocuments can be very difficult and time consuming.\\nBuilt-In Management-Reporting and Analysis Tools\\nAccounting records are maintained in the common database of an ERP system. The\\nadvantage of using a database is that accounting employees can query the records to\\nproduce standard reports as well as answer ad hoc questions. An ad hoc question is onethat is spontaneous. For example, a Fitter manager might walk into an analyst ’s office and\\nask for a sales report for the third quarter —by division and by product. Traditional\\naccounting packages are not optimized to set up and execute queries against accountingrecords, but database packages are. When the records are kept in a database they can be\\nqueried because of the built-in database language.\\nThus, an analyst at Fitter who wants to identify the 10 largest orders placed by Health\\nExpress in the past year could execute a query in SAP ERP to show the answer. Inprinciple, this query could directly access the transaction records to get the answer, which\\nwould mean that analysts running queries would be accessing the records at the same timeas current transactions are being recorded. This competition for resources can slow down\\nprocessing in even a large database system, such as those used by ERP packages.\\nEarly on, SAP addressed the need to minimize the demands on the database system\\nfrom queries on the transaction records by providing special reporting capabilities withinthe ERP system in the form of database tables that store aggregated data. For example, a\\ntable could store sales data summarized by customer on a weekly or monthly basis. Usingdata from these special tables reduces the demands on the database because less data\\nneeds to be pulled from the database; the data comes from special database tables created\\nfor reporting, not from the tables used to process sales transactions. For example, SAPERP provides the Sales Information System (SIS) tool for analyzing sales data and the\\nLogistics Information System (LIS) tool for analyzing production and logistics (shipping)\\nquestions. Both the SIS and the LIS come embedded with SAP ERP and use specialsummary tables to improve reporting efficiency.138Chapter 5\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

A BW system is a completely separate information system that extracts data from\\nthe ERP system. With BW, users have the ability to create reports and perform analyses in asystem that does not compete for system resources with transaction processes. However,\\ncurrent BW systems do require aggregation of data, a process that is complicated and time\\nconsuming. In addition, data aggregation creates limits on what data can be analyzed.\\nA new era of data analysis is dawning with the introduction of in-memory computing.\\nWith in-memory computing, aggregation of the data is not required, eliminating thetime-consuming process that limits analyses. With in-memory computing, detailed records(rather than aggregated data) are maintained in a separate system so the ERP system\\nperformance is not affected, and because the system works on the detailed data records,\\nthere is no limit on the types of analyses that can be performed. Chapter 8 provides moredetail on in-memory computing.\\nAs the previous sections illustrate, an ERP system is a key component in creating\\nmanagement reports. Managerial accounting reports help the company ’s managers\\nunderstand how the company is making money— what products are profitable, where costs\\nmay need to be reduced, and so on. Financial accounting reports are used to informexternal parties— shareholders and government agencies— how well the company is doing\\nfinancially. The importance of accurate accounting reports cannot be overstated, as you\\nwill see in the next section.\\nTHE ENRON COLLAPSE\\nOn October 16, 2001, Enron Corporation, then one of the world ’s largest electricity and\\nnatural gas traders, reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 billionreduction in shareholder equity, related in part to transactions between the company and\\nseveral partnerships run by its chief financial officer (CFO), Andrew Fastow. Until thattime, Enron had been a rapidly growing firm that was revolutionizing the energy trading\\nbusiness and making millionaires out of its investors. CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned\\non August 14, 2001, for personal reasons, had helped transform the company from anatural gas pipeline company to a global marketer and trader of energy. Along the way,\\nthe company had encouraged its employees to invest large portions of their 401K\\nretirement savings accounts in Enron stock by matching employee contributions.\\nOn October 17, the day after Enron reported its tremendous third-quarter loss, the\\nSEC—which is dedicated to protecting investors and maintaining the integrity of the\\nsecurities markets— sent a letter to Enron asking for information about the loss. Enron ’s\\nhigh-flying business practices immediately began unraveling. On October 22, 2001, Enron\\nannounced that the SEC was conducting an inquiry into a possible conflict of interest\\nrelated to the company ’s dealings with the partnerships run by CFO Fastow. Shares of\\nEnron sank more than 20 percent on the news. Two days later, Enron ousted CFO Fastow\\nin an attempt to restore investor confidence. On November 8, Arthur Andersen, Enron ’s\\nfinancial auditing firm, received a federal subpoena for documents related to Enron, and\\non December 2, Enron made the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing in U.S.\\nhistory. Clearly, the accounting records made public by Enron, which were released\\nquarterly and were not audited, did not reflect the financial health of the company.\\nEnron began as an oil pipeline company in Houston in 1985. With the deregulation of\\nelectrical power markets, starting in the mid-1990s, Enron began working as an energy139Accounting in ERP Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

As a broker, Enron entered into\\nseparate contracts with sellers and buyers of energy, making money on the difference\\nbetween the selling price and the buying price. Because Enron kept its books private, it\\nwas the only party that knew both prices. Enron’ s business evolved over time, extending\\nto practices that allowed customers to insure themselves against a range of risk factors,\\nincluding changes in interest rates, weather, and a customer ’s inability to pay. The\\nvolume of these financial contracts eventually became far greater than the volume of\\ncontracts to actually deliver commodities.\\nTo manage the risk in these contracts, Enron employed a team of people with Ph.D.s\\nin mathematics, physics, and economics. Risk management balances the opportunitiesoffered by a business against the risks inherent in taking that business. As Enron ’s\\nbusiness became more complex and its stock soared, the company created partnershipsbetween Enron and companies involved in Internet broadband technologies, computertechnology, and energy, to name a few. While some of the partnerships were set up\\nlegitimately, others were created for the sole purpose of masking billions of dollars in\\ndebt, allowing Enron managers to shift debt off the books.\\nThe partnerships that Fastow engineered were the subject of discussion long before\\nEnron ’s bankruptcy. In a June 1, 1999, article in CFO magazine, Ronald Fink noted that\\nthe Financial Accounting Standards Board was looking at rule changes that would affectcompanies using creative financing techniques, such as those used by Enron. Enron\\nowned a number of subsidiaries, but it made sure that it owned no more than 50 percent\\nof the voting stock, which allowed it to keep the debt and assets of these subsidiaries offEnron ’s own books. If Enron had not used these creative accounting practices, the\\ncompany would have had to report a much higher percentage of debt, which would haveincreased the costs that Enron paid to borrow money.\\nFor years, Enron ’s financial statements had been audited by Arthur Andersen, a\\nhighly regarded accounting firm. As Enron ’s auditor, Andersen issued annual reports\\nattesting to the validity of Enron’ s financial statements; it was supposed to function as an\\nunbiased, incorruptible observer and reporter. Enron’ s October 16, 2001, press release\\ncharacterized numerous charges against income for the third quarter as “nonrecurring, ”\\neven though Andersen had determined that Enron did not have a basis for concluding thatthe charges would in fact be nonrecurring. Andersen advised Enron against using that\\nterm and documented its objections internally in the event of litigation, but the firm did\\nnot report its objections or take any other steps to correct the public statement. OnMarch 7, 2002, Arthur Andersen was charged with obstruction of justice.\\nPerhaps the most damning part of Andersen ’s obstruction of justice indictment related\\nto the destruction of documents. On October 23, 2001, the day after Enron publiclyacknowledged the SEC inquiry, Andersen personnel in Houston were called to mandatory\\nmeetings where they were instructed by Andersen partners and others to immediately\\ndestroy documentation relating to Enron; Andersen employees were told they should workovertime if necessary to accomplish the destruction. Over the next few weeks, employees in\\nseveral Andersen offices worldwide undertook a concerted initiative to shred tons of paper\\ndocumentation and to delete hundreds of computer files relating to Enron.\\nOutcome of the Enron Scandal\\nThe effects of the Enron scandal were felt both within and well beyond the company.Many of Enron ’s shareholders were Enron employees who invested their 401K accounts in140Chapter 5\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Shareholders lost an estimated $40 billion dollars —in many cases,\\nindividuals lost their entire life savings. A class-action lawsuit against financial institutions\\nthat had dealings with Enron (including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, JPMorgan,\\nand Citigroup) produced more than $7 billion in settlements, although legal fees consumeda significant portion of this.\\nThousands of Enron workers lost their jobs, and 31 individuals were either charged or\\npled guilty to criminal charges. J. Clifford Baxter resigned as Enron ’s vice chairman on\\nMay 2, 2001. He was found shot to death in his car on January 15, 2002, in an apparent\\nsuicide. In 2006, Andrew Fastow, Enron ’s former chief financial officer, was sentenced to\\nsix years in prison. His sentence had been limited to a maximum of 10 years as part of a\\nplea agreement in which he agreed to testify against former CEO Jeffrey Skilling and CEO\\nKen Lay. Fastow ’s wife, Lea, also received a one-year prison sentence for filing a false\\nincome tax return. In October 2006, Jeffrey Skilling was convicted on 19 counts of\\nconspiracy, fraud, insider trading, and making false statements to auditors. He was ordered\\nto pay nearly $45 million into a restitution fund for Enron ’s victims, and was sentenced to\\n24 years in jail. Although he is appealing his conviction, he began serving his sentence in\\nlate 2006. Ken Lay was convicted on fraud and conspiracy charges in May 2006, but two\\nmonths later, prior to being sentenced, he died of a heart attack.\\nOn June 15, 2002, jurors convicted the accounting firm Arthur Andersen of\\nobstructing justice by destroying Enron documents while on notice of a federalinvestigation. Andersen executives had claimed that the documents were destroyed as part\\nof general housekeeping duties, and not as a ruse to keep Enron documents away from theregulators. That October, U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon sentenced Andersen to the\\nmaximum: a $500,000 fine and five years ’probation. Those events were anticlimactic,\\nhowever, as the former auditing giant had been all but dismantled by then. Once a world-\\nclass firm with over 85,000 employees globally, Andersen has since been whittled down to\\nalmost nothing. As of early 2012, Andersen has not declared bankruptcy or been dissolved,\\nbut it is no longer an active company.\\nAs a result of the failure of Enron, as well as the high-profile bankruptcies of\\nWorldCom and Global Crossing, the United States Congress passed the Sarbanes-OxleyAct of 2002. This act was intended to prevent the kind of fraud and abuse that led to theEnron downfall.\\nKey Features of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act is designed to encourage top management accountability in firmsthat are publicly traded in the United States. Frequently, top executives involved in\\ncorporate scandals claim that they were unaware of abuses occurring at their company. Title\\nIX of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that financial statements filed with the SEC include astatement signed by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, certifying that the\\nfinancial statement complies with the SEC rules. Specifically, the statements must certify\\nthat “the information contained in the periodic report fairly presents, in all material\\nrespects, the financial condition and results of operations of the issuer. ”Anyone who\\nwillfully certifies a statement “knowing that the periodic report accompanying the statement\\ndoes not comport with all the requirements set forth in this section shall be fined not morethan $5,000,000, or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.”141Accounting in ERP Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Among other things, this section of\\nthe act limits the nonaudit services that an auditor can provide to an audit client; the\\nprohibited nonaudit services include the following:\\n\\x81Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial\\nstatements\\n\\x81Financial information systems design and implementation services\\n\\x81Legal services\\n\\x81Expert services unrelated to the audit\\n\\x81Management functions\\n\\x81Human resources functions\\n\\x81Any other service that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\\n(PCAOB) determines to be impermissible. (The PCAOB was created in Title I of\\nthe act with broad powers to regulate audits and auditors of public companies.)\\nTitle IV of the act covers enhanced financial disclosures, and it specifies more stringent\\nrequirements for financial reporting. Section 404 of Title IV requires that a public company ’s\\nannual report contain management ’s internal control report. The control report must outline\\nmanagement ’s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over\\nfinancial reporting, and it must also assess the effectiveness of the company ’si n t e r n a lc o n t r o l\\nstructure and procedures. Section 409 of Title IV addresses the timeliness of reports, and mayrequire companies to file an SEC report within two days of a significant trigger event —for\\nexample, completion of an acquisition or a default by a major customer.\\nIMPLICATIONS OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT\\nFOR ERP SYSTEMS\\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act has had significant ramifications for the design of information\\nsystems of publicly traded companies. To meet the internal control report requirement, acompany must first document the controls that are in place and then verify that they are\\nnot subject to error or manipulation.\\nAn integrated information system provides the tools to implement internal controls, as\\nlong as the system is configured and managed correctly. However, even the passage of theSarbanes-Oxley Act and the availability of state-of-the-art ERP technology cannot prevent\\nthe type of insidious and systematic fraud that was involved in the Enron scandal. An ERPsystem relies on a central database with accurate information. ERP systems make it difficult\\nto hide fraudulent dealings, and perhaps Enron ’s problems would have been more obvious to\\nstakeholders of the company had the company implemented an ERP system. But it is\\nunlikely that an ERP system or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act can prevent all fraud.142Chapter 5\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The backbone of the act was\\nincreased responsibility placed on company executives. The act allows the SEC to seize pay\\nfrom the CEOs and CFOs of companies found to have filed fraudulent financial statements,even if the executives were not directly involved in the fraud. However, some experts, suchas Jack T. Ciesielski, president of R. G. Associates and the editor of The Analyst ’s\\nAccounting Observer , believe the act is a “dormant enforcement tool ”and is not a\\ndeterrent because it is not really being used. A primary challenge to enforcing theSarbanes-Oxley Act is that much of the language in the bill was poorly drafted andambiguous. In addition to the small number of cases filed under Sarbanes-Oxley, half of thecompanies that have been charged have been small companies, and many cases have yet tobe resolved.\\nRecently, however, some larger companies have been charged with violations of the\\nact. For instance, Navistar was charged by the SEC with overstating its income from2001 to 2005, and, as a result, the chief executive of the company, along with the formerchief financial executive, were forced to give back stock they had earned during thattime frame. Similarly, the former CEO at Diebold (a maker of automated tellermachines) was forced to repay cash and stock after the SEC charged the company withoverstating its results over the course of five years. And in a recent case against BeazerHomes and two of its former executives, the SEC collected $8 million and 119,000shares of Beazer stock. While these cases do involve larger companies, with executivesbeing forced to return at least some portion of their compensation, many feel thatenforcement is still lacking. According to Harvey Goldschmid, a professor at ColumbiaLaw School and a former SEC commissioner, “The trick is to create deterrents and\\naccountability in the system. You don ’t do it if you ’re soft on individuals. ”\\nQuestion:\\n1. Use the Internet to research the latest news surrounding the Sarbanes-Oxley\\nAct.

Before material\\ndata can be deleted from the SAP ERP system, a user must create an auditable record of\\nits existence. Data are removed from the SAP ERP system only after they have been\\nrecorded to media (tape backup, DVD-R) for permanent storage. This permanently stored\\ndata, or archive , allows auditors to reconstruct the company ’s financial position at any\\npoint in the past.\\nSuppose data could be freely deleted from an ERP system. An unscrupulous employee\\ncould create a fictitious vendor, post an invoice from the vendor, have payment made forthe bogus invoice to a Swiss bank account, and then delete all records of this transaction.\\nIt would be very hard to detect the fraud and probably impossible to find out who\\ncommitted it, because the records would no longer exist.\\nNot only does the SAP ERP system require archiving before data can be deleted, but it\\nalso keeps track of when data are created or changed. Figure 5-12 shows the changerecord for the material master. Each time a user changes the material master, the changerecord tracks the change in the data, who changed them, and when the change occurred.\\nFor example, in Figure 5-12, you can see that Cindy made changes to the material ’s basic\\ndata (such as the description, measurement units, or weight) on April 28, 2010.144Chapter 5\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

In the SAP ERP system, this is done using tolerance groups. As you\\nlearned in Chapter 2, tolerance groups are preset limits that define transaction limits.Tolerance groups are used to set limits on the dollar value for a single item in a document\\nas well as on the total value of the document. Just as importantly, they are used to set a\\nlimit on payment differences.

What changes must you make in your accounting practices to get\\nthe company in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act? Write a proposal to your\\nmanager outlining your plan to be ready for the additional amount of reporting necessary.For this exercise, assume that Fitter does not have an ERP system in place.\\nTRENDS IN FINANCIAL REPORTING —XBRL\\nThe finance departments of most corporations are under pressure from a variety ofsources. The financial crisis of 2008 along with the global recession has affected almost all\\ncompanies. Profit margins are being squeezed, market volatility has brought increased\\nrisk, and new government regulations are more numerous and complex. As notedpreviously, ERP software can help companies effectively handle challenges such as\\ncomplying with Sarbanes Oxley regulations. Another regulation, put forth by the SEC in\\n2009, is the Interactive Data to Improve Financial Reporting rule, which requires thegradual implementation of XBRL tags in financial reporting documents.\\nExtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is a standards-based language for\\nthe electronic communication of business and financial data. XBRL is a subset ofExtensible Markup Language (XML) , the new programming language of the Internet. XML\\nuses tags that define the data contained within them. Similar to data types assigned torecords in a database, XML tags apply specific meaning to the data within a Web page.XML-coded data can go directly from a Web page into a database without having to pass\\nthrough middleware or, worse yet, be rekeyed into the system. This reduces the chance of\\nerrors. In comparison, most current Internet pages are written in Hypertext MarkupLanguage (HTML). HTML specifies only how your data will look (by assigning text styles,\\ncoloring, placement of graphics, and so on) when viewed through a browser. XML changes\\nthat data into information with meaning and usefulness. For financial reporting, XBRLprovides an identifying, computer-readable tag for each item of financial data. For\\ninstance, “company net profit ”has its own unique XBRL tag.\\nApart from new regulations, there are other reasons why XBRL is becoming prevalent.\\nReports written in XBRL are processed faster because the imbedded tags directly relate toa database, and XBRL financial reports can more easily be validated electronically and\\nthen compared to other reports. More importantly, investors and other interested parties\\nare concerned with transparency in reporting. To assess the risk of a given investment,\\nthe investor must understand the financial aspects of the investment. If a report isobscure or hiding information, then the risk is not easily assessed. XBRL results in more\\ntransparency of reporting.\\nXBRL is controlled by a nonprofit group of 600 international companies and other\\norganizations, including governmental agencies. The group is responsible for creating andstandardizing these financial tags. In addition to the SEC, entities such as the U.S. Federal\\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which provides deposit insurance guaranteeing thesafety of deposits in member banks, and Her Majesty ’s Revenue & Customs (the United\\nKingdom ’s customs and tax-collection departments), are beginning to require the use of\\nXBRL tags.\\nERP systems can accept data in XML and XBRL format. For example, SAP’ s Business\\nObjects XBRL Publishing tool allows users to avoid complex tags and simply use a drag-and-drop system for categorizing financial data.150Chapter 5\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Accounting activities can generally be classified as either financial accountingor managerial accounting.\\n\\x81Financial accounting consists of documenting all the transactions of a company that haveanimpact on the financial state of the organization, and then using those documented\\ntransactions to create reports for investors and external parties and agencies. Managerial\\naccounting deals with determining the costs and profitability of a company ’s activities. The\\ngoal of managerial accounting is to provide managers with detailed information so they can\\nmake informed decisions, create budgets, determine the profitability of a particular product,\\nsales region, or marketing campaign, and so on.\\n\\x81An accounting system should let a user summarize data in meaningful ways so the data\\ncanthen be used to assist managers in their day-to-day work and in long-range planning.\\n\\x81Unintegrated information systems are more likely to result in accounting data that isinaccurate or not current, which can affect decision making and therefore profitability.\\n\\x81Closing the books means that balances for temporary or nominal accounts (such asrevenue, expense, gain, and loss) are transferred to the retained earnings account. An\\nintegrated information system simplifies the process of closing the books and preparing\\nfinancial statements. Using an integrated information system and a common database to\\nrecord accounting data has important inventory cost-accounting benefits. More preciserecord keeping is possible, which can lead to more accurate product cost calculations.\\nThese, in turn, can help managers determine which products are profitable and which are\\nnot.\\n\\x81The use of an integrated system and a common database to record accounting data has\\nimportant management-reporting benefits. With an ERP system, a user can use the built-in\\nquery tools to build reports as well as drill down within reports to the source documents\\n(transactions) that were used to create the report.\\n\\x81The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, passed in the wake of the Enron collapse and other high-profile bankruptcies, promoted management accountability by requiring extra financial\\napproval and reporting. Because ERP systems can help companies meet the requirements\\nof this legislation, the act has increased the demand for integrated data reporting.\\n\\x81Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), a subset of XML (Extensible MarkupLanguage), is a standards-based language for the electronic communication of business\\nand financial data. For financial reporting, XBRL provides an identifying, computer-readable\\ntag for each item of financial data. For instance, “company net profit ”has its own unique\\nXBRL tag.151Accounting in ERP Systems\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Some researchers expected that\\njob opportunities for accountants would diminish with the implementation of an ERP\\nsystem. In reality, accountants are needed more than ever in industry. Use an online job\\nsearch Web site and look at the jobs available for accountants. How many positions require\\nexperience with ERP systems? Do any positions require data analysis capabilities thatinvolve Business Warehouse technology?\\n6. Companies usually prepare annual division- and company-wide budgets that show\\nprojected monthly results, such as: sales, cost of sales, inventory levels, cash on hand, and\\nother key data. Such budgets are effective for planning and controlling operations if they\\nare designed as “flexible” budgets. A flexible budget is restated as conditions change from\\nmonth to month, so goals remain reasonable and useful for evaluating performance. If not\\nkept up to date, budgets are not useful for planning and controlling operations.\\nIf information systems are unintegrated, getting data from the company ’s departments to\\ncreate the initial budget is a chore, and keeping the data current is often so difficult that it is\\nnot done. Thus, while the flexible budget concept is a good idea, it is difficult to achieve\\nwith unintegrated systems. Because ERP makes flexible budgeting more achievable, ERP156Chapter 5\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

The Human Resources\\nDepartment ’s recruiting, hiring, and postplacement processes would operate more\\nefficiently with an integrated information system.\\nRecruiting Process\\nWhen a department within Fitter has an opening for a new employee, the department\\nsupervisor communicates this need to the Human Resources Department by filling out apaper job vacancy form that describes the position, lists the qualifications a candidate\\nmust have, specifies the type of position (temporary, part-time, full-time, or internship),\\nand states when the position will become available. Using this information, HumanResources gets final approval from the president of Fitter to begin the recruiting process.\\nBecause there is no central information system, the details on the job vacancy form are\\nfrequently inconsistent among, and sometimes within, departments. For example, therequirements for a clerical position in one department includes experience with\\nMicrosoft Word, while in another department, the specification is for experience with\\nMicrosoft Office.\\nUsually a job is initially posted internally so current employees have the first\\nopportunity to apply for the position. If no current employees are acceptable for theposition, then Fitter posts the position externally.\\nProblems can occur throughout Fitter ’s recruiting process. First, the description of the\\nrequired job qualifications may be incomplete or inaccurate —sometimes because the\\nsupervisor is in a hurry, sometimes because the supervisor is not aware of all of thefunctions required for the position, and sometimes because the supervisor assumes that all\\ncandidates will have certain basic skills. Second, if the job vacancy form is lost or not\\nrouted properly, the Human Resources Department will not know that the position isavailable, while the supervisor assumes that the paperwork is in process. When this\\nhappens, the department can end up shorthanded, creating productivity issues as well as\\nthe possibility of tension or animosity between the departments. Obviously, this problemis more likely to occur when job openings are circulated by paper. With an integrated\\ninformation system, job information is available immediately and is easier to monitor.\\nAnother serious recruiting problem related to a paper-based hiring process is the potentialloss of a good candidate due to drawn-out hiring practices or lost data.\\nAlthough Fitter does not use recruiting agencies or Internet job sites such as\\nMonster.com to find candidates, it does use several other methods. The companypublishes its job vacancies on the company ’s Web site, in local newspapers, and, in the\\ncase of management positions, in national publications. In addition, a representative fromthe Human Resources Department attends career fairs and recruits on college campusesfor prospective candidates. Occasionally, referrals are made by other Fitter employees,\\nand sometimes individuals searching for open positions at Fitter send unsolicited résumés.\\nFiling and keeping track of résumés and applications is an ongoing challenge. Fitter\\nhas dozens of jobs with different titles and descriptions, and the company receives dozensof résumés and applications each day. The Human Resources Department must classify\\nand file all applications and résumés according to the appropriate description. Forexample, if the résumé of a mechanical engineer is accidentally filed with résumés of\\ncandidates applying for jobs in the accounting department, the mistake may not be\\ndiscovered in time to include the engineer in the search process. In this case, Fitter may161Human Resources Processes with ERP\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

To generate a list of potentialcandidates, Human Resources evaluates the résumés and applications it receives in\\nresponse to a job posting; it also reviews applications that have been on file for less than a\\nyear. These résumés and applications must be photocopied and then circulated throughthe department making the job request. Frequently, more than one person in the\\nrequesting department reviews the applications, and because the applicant data are on\\npaper, managers review the applicant files sequentially, slowing the review process.\\nThe Interviewing and Hiring Process\\nAt Fitter, the requesting department develops a short list of candidates for the position by\\nselecting up to three applicants, based on the data provided by the Human Resources\\nDepartment. Human Resources contacts the candidates on the short list, schedules\\ninterviews, and creates a file for each candidate. A candidate ’s file includes a form that\\nshows when the application was received, the position(s) applied for by the candidate, and\\nthe date and time of any interviews. If this is not the first time the candidate has applied\\nfor a job with the company, the form indicates the more recent status of the candidate:whether the candidate was interviewed and rejected, whether the candidate rejected a job\\noffer, and so on.\\nIf a candidate accepts the interview offer, the Human Resources Department makes\\nthe arrangements for the job candidate, including travel arrangements and a schedule ofinterview activities. A representative from the Human Resources Department conducts an\\ninterview that includes a discussion of the applicant ’s experience and questions relevant to\\nthe position for which the candidate has applied. The supervisor of the department in\\nwhich the position exists also interviews the candidate, and other employees in the\\ndepartment are usually given time to talk to the candidate as well. For most professionalpositions at Fitter, the candidate is interviewed by the plant manager and, frequently, the\\ncompany president.\\nAfter the initial interview process, a Human Resources ’staff member updates the\\ncandidate ’s file to indicate whether he or she is still a possibility for hire. In some cases, a\\nsecond interview is scheduled. Once someone in Human Resources has interviewed all the\\ncandidates on the short list, a representative of the Human Resources Department and thesupervisor of the requesting department rank the candidates on the short list. If there is an\\nacceptable candidate, the Human Resources employee makes that person a verbal job\\noffer over the phone. If the candidate accepts the verbal offer, a written offer letter is sent,which the candidate must sign and return. Once the candidate formally accepts the\\nwritten offer, his or her file is again updated, showing that the candidate has accepted the\\noffer. The Human Resources person then schedules a background check and drug test forthe candidate, determines the employee ’s start date and makes plans for the new\\nemployee ’s orientation session.\\nIf no acceptable candidates were found, or if none of them accepts the job offer, then\\nthe process must be repeated, which at a minimum will require the development of a new\\nshort list but may involve starting over with a new job posting.\\nMany of Fitter ’s problems in the interviewing and hiring process have to do with\\ninformation flow and communication. Fitter does not have group appointment calendar162Chapter 6\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

A group appointment calendar\\n(available in email systems and ERP systems such as SAP) allows users to check others ’\\ncalendars to schedule meetings. Without such a calendar tool, scheduling interviews is\\nfrequently a cumbersome process, requiring the Human Resources employee to coordinate\\nthe interview schedule between the candidate and the appropriate personnel at Fitter. Because\\nthis is done by email and phone, it can take days and sometimes weeks to schedule aninterview. A similar problem occurs after the interviews have been completed. Gathering\\nfeedback from all involved parties and ranking the candidates takes time and may require\\nmultiple meetings. Managing the travel arrangements and reimbursing candidates for theirtravel expenses are also cumbersome tasks. More than once, Fitter has lost a promising\\ncandidate to another company because of delays in the Fitter interviewing and hiring process.\\nFitter hires a human resources consulting firm to perform drug tests and conduct\\nbackground checks to verify that candidates have not falsified any information and do nothave serious criminal records. Fitter outsources this work because of the special skills\\nrequired. If the background check and drug test are satisfactory, this information is addedto the candidate’ s file, and the job offer stands. If the consultant finds evidence of falsified\\ninformation or legal troubles or the candidate fails the drug test, the file is likewiseupdated, and the job offer is rescinded with a written explanation.\\nOn a new employee ’s first day of work, he or she attends an orientation meeting, which\\nincludes completing additional paperwork covering employment terms and conditions, taxwithholding, and benefits. All Fitter employees must sign a form that states that theemployee has been given a copy of —and agrees to abide by —the company ’s policies and\\nprocedures. The new employee must complete an IRS W-4 form, which tells the employerthe correct amount of tax to withhold from the employee ’s paycheck. Next, a Human\\nResources representative reviews Fitter’ s benefits plan. Fitter offers a comprehensive\\nbenefits plan that gives employees a range of choices for healthcare plans, life insurance,retirement plans, and medical savings accounts. The employee ’s dependents may also be\\ncovered under Fitter ’s health insurance plan. If the employee elects dependent coverage,\\nthen the Human Resources Department must obtain basic information about eachdependent to include in the employee ’s file.\\nBecause employees must provide a significant amount of detailed data to properly\\nmanage compensation and benefits, it is not surprising that Fitter frequently has problemsenrolling new employees in the correct benefits plans and establishing the proper payrolldeductions. It can often take months to manage the new employee ’s compensation and\\nbenefits correctly. The enrollment issues can generate many time-consuming phone calls toHuman Resources management —calls that would not be needed with an integrated system.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nHuman Resources Data in the Cloud\\nCloud computing, discussed in more detail in Chapter 8, is the use of computing services\\nprovided by another company.

Companies must develop procedures to control access to this\\ninformation. If a company ’s human resources data is stored on the cloud, it is much\\nmore difficult to ensure that the data is managed in a manner that meets privacy laws.\\nA company cannot simply assume that the cloud-computing supplier provides this\\nsecurity. For example, in 2011, German data protection authorities adopted an“orientation guide ”to cloud computing that emphasizes that German cloud computing\\ncustomers are responsible for compliance with all data protection requirements underGerman law. This compliance includes all subprocessors involved in providing cloudcomputing services. Thus, it is not sufficient for a company to just accept the cloudcomputing provider ’s assurance that its systems are secure. Cloud computing customers\\nshould “access logs, tour the data center, go through data center questionnaires and see\\nwho has the administrator ’s password, ”according to Grady Summers, principal,\\ninformation security, at Ernst & Young. “Make sure that the service provider can meet\\nregulatory requirements as well. ”\\nQuestions:\\n1. What modifications would be required to a company ’s standard human\\nresources security procedures to address using a cloud-based humanresources information system? What documentation would you require fromthe service provider?\\n2. Will laws and regulations affecting cloud-based human resources systems\\nbecome more standardized and simpler in the future, or will there be a growthin complexity with an increase in associated costs? Provide the reasoningbehind your answer.\\nHuman Resources Duties After Hiring\\nA human resources department has responsibilities that continue beyond the hiring and\\njob start of an employee. The human resources department must maintain an ongoing line\\nof communication with the employee and his or her supervisor to make sure the employee\\nis performing well.\\nFitter, like most companies, issues performance evaluations to new and current\\nemployees. As part of the process, the supervisor performs an evaluation and reviews itwith the employee. After the review, the supervisor may modify the evaluation, whichboth the supervisor and the employee then sign. The employee may also submit a written\\nresponse to the review, listing any disagreements or explanations. The employee ’s\\ndepartment manager is expected to review the performance evaluation and employee\\nresponse, and may add a separate written comment. The completed package is then\\nforwarded to the Human Resources Department, where all documents become part of the\\nemployee ’s file. These files are critically important if an employee fails to perform\\nadequately over a period of time. If an employee must be terminated, the company needs\\nsufficient documentation to demonstrate that the termination is warranted; otherwise, if164Chapter 6\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

This makes it more challenging for the Human ResourcesDepartment to identify problems with an employee and take corrective action (such as job\\nperformance counseling or a transfer) before the problems lead to termination. With\\nFitter ’s paper-based system, an employee ’s file can be viewed by only one person at a\\ntime, and it is possible to lose track of an employee ’s file —temporarily or permanently.\\nAlso, it is difficult to maintain proper control of sensitive personal information when it ismaintained in paper files.\\nEmployee turnover can be a significant problem for a company. The cost of hiring an\\nemployee has been estimated from thousands of dollars to over $50,000. When evaluatingthe cost of hiring an employee, a company should consider both the direct costs of hiring anemployee and the less tangible costs that occur during a new employee ’s first year or so. For\\nexample, while new employees are learning their jobs, other employees have to take timefrom their normal jobs to train them, which can negatively impact their productivity.\\nAnother cost that is difficult to quantify is an employee ’s experience and job\\nknowledge, which is lost when he or she leaves a company. For example, if a purchasingmanager leaves a company, then all of the manager ’s knowledge about supplier relations\\nmay be lost. The company would have records of the contracts signed with various\\nsuppliers, but details of the negotiations that led to each contract may not be documented.\\nSuch details can be crucial in successfully negotiating the next contract. The manager mayhave developed good relations with a certain supplier and know whom to contact when\\nproblems arise. These relationships are not specified as part of the purchasing manager\\nposition but accrue over time with the individual holding the position. When companiesexperience high rates of turnover, they lose knowledge and skills that may be crucial to\\nkeeping them competitive.\\nEmployee turnover is strongly tied to job satisfaction and compensation. If employees\\nhave satisfying jobs and are well compensated, they are less likely to leave the company.Human resources can help maintain a satisfying work environment through a number of\\nmeans, such as by holding training programs for supervisors and managers, conductingperiodic employee satisfaction surveys, and gathering data from employee exit surveys.\\nHuman resources also has a critical role to play in compensation, which should be related\\nto the skills and tasks required by the job and the performance of the employee. Oneimportant function of a human resources department is to make sure compensation levels\\nare competitive and are applied fairly to all employees. Failure to do so can result in high\\nrates of turnover as well as discrimination lawsuits.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nAt Novartis, Reputation Did Not Match Reality\\nAfter 10 years of being on Working Mother magazine ’s“100 Best Companies for Working\\nMothers ”list, Novartis pharmaceutical settled a gender discrimination class action\\nlawsuit in 2010 for $175 million dollars.

Novartis had numerous programs designed to help working\\nmothers. As noted in a 2009 article in Working Mother magazine, Novartis offered\\n“lunch and learn” sessions on pediatric issues ranging from sleep to nutrition. The\\ncompany also offered a variety of childcare benefits, including discounts on full-timecare at national daycare chains and in-home sick care, and the company made a$1,000 childcare contribution to anyone who saved $4,000 in a pretax childcareaccount.\\nUnfortunately, these innovative programs apparently did not reflect the culture of\\nthe sales organization at Novartis. The class action lawsuit included numerous charges ofsexual harassment and unfair denial of pay raises and promotions. As noted in a Wall\\nStreet Journal article, the court found that new mothers or pregnant women were\\nsingled out. For example, one mother was passed over for promotion because thecompany felt that she would not be able to leave home for the travel involved in the jobbecause she had four children. In another instance, one woman who was highly-rated inher company evaluations was overlooked for further management education. And somepregnant women were given an extra workload because a manager thought the maternityleave policy at Novartis was too generous.\\nIn addition to the financial payment to the plaintiffs, the settlement requires\\nNovartis to implement a number of changes to its human resource processes, including:\\n•Revising its policies and processes for investigating discrimination claims\\n•Implementing specified changes to its performance evaluation system and\\nconducting mandatory training for all managers regarding that system\\n•Creating an appeals process for employees who disagree with theirperformance ratings\\n•Implementing changes to its management development program training\\n•Implementing changes to its tracking and monitoring of promotionalopportunities\\nProbably the most important factor in avoiding workplace discrimination is making sure\\nthe culture of the company does not tolerate it, but good Human Resource informationprocesses can provide the data and tools to analyze and monitor a company ’s Human\\nResource practices to avoid discrimination.\\nQuestions:\\n1.

An integrated information system is\\na key component in this process.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nData Analytics for Enhancing Performance and\\nRecruiting in Professional Sports\\nAn organization ’s human resources department is typically responsible for a large amount\\nof data, and sports teams are no exception. Many teams collect and analyze huge volumes\\nof data in hopes of improving player performance and recruiting high-quality players.Recently, Gartner Research named data analytics one of the most important “strategic\\ntechnologies ”in 2011, and the London Irish rugby club can attest to that. During games,\\nthe team collects video data (including GPS data) to analyze factors such as distances runand the g-force of various tackles. Injury analysis can be correlated with this rich data setto teach players to use techniques that will minimize the potential for injury. This richdata set not only aids in future game direction but also helps in training. However, thebusiness director of the team, Chris Miles, adds a caveat, “You can ’t use analytics to\\nreplace judgment— it supports it. ”The Manchester City football (soccer) club also uses\\ndata analytics to assess performance during game play. The club measures about 180actions during a game, but it does not rely solely on data analysis. As with the rugby team,coach intuition supersedes any data result.\\nIn England, players are often traded from football club to another, in hopes of\\nimproving a team ’s performance. Trading is common because of the heavy pressure on\\nclubs to win. Hence football clubs spend a large amount of money obtaining topexperienced players. In hopes of nurturing new, younger players, and alleviating some ofthe enormous expense of trading experienced players, a new rule —called the Home\\nGrown Player rule —has been enacted by the England ’s top football league. This requires\\nteams to have at least eight players that have been with the team for three seasonsstarting before that player turned 21. With fewer opportunities to improve teams throughtrades, teams must make better recruiting decisions to be successful. Prozone, a softwaretool accessed through the cloud, allows teams to analyze performance data on playersand perform what-if analyses on potential trades. It takes football performance data —\\nsuch as video, shots, percentage passes, tackles won, along with age and nationality, anduses statistics to determine performance ratings.

Employees are, not surprisingly, very particular about being paid the correctamount at the correct time. Without proper management of the payroll process,\\nemployees might not be paid for all of the hours they worked, they might not be paid at\\nthe appropriate rate, or they might have too much or too little money withheld from theirpay for taxes and benefits. Mistakes in payroll can cause significant job dissatisfaction.\\nThe two key processes in determining the pay an employee receives are calculation of\\nthe remuneration elements and determination of statutory and voluntary deductions. Theremuneration elements of an employee ’s pay include the base pay, bonuses, gratuities,\\novertime pay, sick pay, and vacation allowances the employee has earned during the payperiod. The statutory and voluntary deductions are paycheck withholdings, including\\ntaxes (federal, state, local, Social Security, and Medicare), company loans, and benefit\\ncontributions. Properly determining the pay for an employee requires accurate input data\\nand correct evaluation of remuneration elements and deductions.\\nThe process of determining each employee ’s pay is called a payroll run. In the payroll\\nrun, the SAP ERP system evaluates the input data and notes any discrepancies in anerror log . Payroll employees review the error log, make any necessary corrections, and\\nrepeat the payroll run until no errors are recorded. Then the payroll run is used to\\ngenerate employee pay statements, process electronic funds transfers to individual\\nemployees ’bank accounts, submit tax payments to the appropriate government entities,\\nand perform other calculations as required by human resources and accounting.\\nTravel Management\\nMany companies spend a substantial amount of money on employee travel, and managing\\ntravel and its associated expenses can be a significant task. A travel request, which may\\noriginate with the employee or the employee ’s manager, is the first step in the travel\\nmanagement process. Travel requests usually require management approval, and the\\norganizational level at which travel must be approved may depend on the duration,\\nlocation, and cost of the travel. Once management has approved the travel, employeesmust make their travel reservations. Because airfare, hotel, and rental car costs can vary\\nwidely, companies frequently require employees to make reservations through either a\\ncompany travel office or a travel agency that is under contract to the company. Theemployee must keep receipts for expenses incurred during the trip in order to complete an\\nexpense report and receive reimbursement. The SAP ERP Travel Management system\\nfacilitates this process by maintaining travel data for each employee— including flight,173Human Resources Processes with ERP\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Companies using the SAP ERP Travel Management\\nsystem can also make use of a Web-based application that allows employees to submitexpense reports through a Web browser.\\nTravel management is also getting easier —and mobile —with SAP ’s Travel OnDemand\\nproduct, which is hosted by SAP and accessed via the Internet. (As noted in Chapter 2,this software delivery model, called software as a service, or SaaS, is a subset of cloud\\ncomputing and is discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.) With Travel OnDemand,\\nemployees can use their smartphones to automatically categorize their travel expensesby simply taking a picture of each receipt. The system then reads the receipt and puts\\nit in the correct expense category. For instance, a receipt from a restaurant would\\nbe categorized under meals, while a train ticket receipt would be placed undertransportation. When the employee returns to the office after a trip, the expense report is\\nalready almost complete. This is a huge help to employees who spend a large portion of\\ntheir time on the road; the hassle of gathering receipts and filling out paperwork is often asource of significant source of job dissatisfaction for employees who travel frequently. In\\naddition, employees using Travel OnDemand are able to query the system about travel and\\nexpense policies, such as the company policy on taking clients out to dinner.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nWhat’ s New in Human Capital Management (HCM)\\nThe goals and aspirations of a company ’s employees should be aligned with the strategic\\ngoals of organizations. Surprisingly, research shows that 95 percent of employees are\\nunaware or do not understand their company ’s strategic goals. In addition, newly\\nrecruited employees often do not perform as well as hoped because the employee ’s\\npersonal goals are not aligned with those of the organization. Tools now exist that allowhiring organizations to assess potential candidates not only on their intelligence but alsoon other, harder to define characteristics, such as motivation and behavior.\\nOnce an employee is hired, new performance evaluation tools allow companies to\\nassess employees in a consistent manner across the organization. Traditionally,individual managers within a company perform evaluations, which might be based on\\ncriteria that is inconsistent between different managers. This variation can cause\\nproblems when employees are evaluated across departments, perhaps for an internalpromotion or a new job. Tools that improve the consistency of evaluations help toalleviate this problem. Many companies are also working to improve their performanceassessment process through the use of the “360-degree evaluation, ”in which employees\\nperform their own evaluations, and are also evaluated not only by their managers, butalso by their coworkers, and perhaps even their customers.\\nAlthough many organizations are still using spreadsheets to analyze their workforce,\\nthose that use the SAP ERP software have the advantage of fast prediction. Using SAP ’s\\nnew in-memory computing (HANA) feature, the Human Capital Management module cannow handle large volumes of employee data— such as data related to hiring, promotion,\\nand termination —to predict the three- and five-year makeup of the workforce.

In what ways could social networking improve human capital management\\nsoftware?\\nTraining and Development Coordination\\nThe Personnel Development component of the SAP ERP Human Resources module allows\\ncompanies to plan and implement employee development and training activities that\\nmaximize an employee ’s ability to contribute to the organization. Because advances in\\ntechnology can quickly render an employee ’s knowledge obsolete, employees will not\\nremain productive without continuing development and training efforts. In addition, manypositions require certifications that must be updated, and continuing education isfrequently required for recertification. Without an effective human resources information\\nsystem, managing the training, development, and certification needs for a company ’s\\nemployees can be both time consuming and prone to error.\\nIn the SAP ERP system, employee development is driven by qualifications and\\nrequirements. Requirements are skills or abilities associated with a position, while\\nqualifications are skills or abilities associated with a specific employee. Requirements and\\nqualifications refer to the same concept from a different perspective. By using the SAPPersonnel Development tool, a manager can compare an employee ’s qualifications with the\\nrequirements for a position to which the employee aspires. This comparison enables the\\nmanager to identify gaps and to plan development and training efforts to close those gaps.\\nIt can also serve as a basis for employee evaluation, and it can help motivate the employee\\nby providing a goal and the means to achieve it.\\nOne of the most important reasons companies must manage the development and\\ntraining of employees is the need for succession planning . A succession plan outlines the\\nstrategy for replacing key employees when they leave the company or move to another\\nposition within the company. The success of a company depends in large part on the skills,\\nabilities, and experience of its management team. This is especially true for small companieslike Fitter. Savvy customers have been known to avoid establishing long-term relationships\\nwith companies that do not have well-developed succession plans. The Career and\\nSuccession Planning components of the SAP ERP Human Resources module allow humanresources professionals to create, implement, and evaluate succession planning scenarios.\\nHuman resources departments use career planning tools when working with individual\\nemployees, identifying potential career goals and drawing up career plans. Companies usesuccession planning tools to find people to fill unoccupied positions. Succession planning\\nallows human resources employees to meet staffing requirements by proactively identifying\\ncandidate employees within the company and ensuring that their training and developmentplans will prepare them for the new position when it becomes available. Using the career and\\nsuccession planning tools in an ERP system ensures that human resources will have accurate\\nand timely employee and position data when developing those plans. The system also letshuman resources staff more easily track and integrate personnel changes (such as new175Human Resources Processes with ERP\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The average CIO lasts three to five years at a company, and abouttwo-thirds of the time a replacement is found outside the organization. At E. & J. GalloWinery, the current CIO, Kent Kushar, has made it a point to work with the HumanResources Department to find himself a successor. He found one possible candidate inthe Sales and Marketing Department, a vice president named Kevin Barnes. Barnesunderstood Gallo ’s strategy of linking technology with a customer-oriented approach.\\nBarnes was sent on a CIO training course, so to speak. The course, run by HarvardProfessor Jim Cash, is a six-month training course with workshops, teleconferences, andpersonal advisers. The cost of the course is $35,000, but those who complete it generallyfind themselves ready to step into a CIO job.\\nExperienced CIOs have put together a list of key ideas for creating a good\\nsuccession plan, as explained in the magazine, CIO:\\n•Perform needs assessments —Focus on the skills and the type of\\ninformation technology leadership that the company will require in the\\nfuture. HCM software can help a company standardize the assessment of\\npotential candidates for leadership positions. Also, find out who is going to\\nretire over the next several years.\\n•Determine how far down the ladder the plan will go —Ideally, successions\\nplans should also be developed for middle management, so if someoneleaves the company, the transition to promotion is smooth. Again, HCMsoftware can be used to track the skill set of each employee to identify\\nthose who are ready to move up.\\n•Evaluate skills, performance, and goals for growth— Performance\\nevaluations of employees can accomplish this task. At MarriottInternational, an employee ’s performance evaluation is compared to a set\\nof company “key dimensions. ”This helps Marriott to not only do\\nsuccession planning, but also to ensure their employees are utilized to theirfull potential.\\n•Identify potential —This task is usually performed by senior management, such\\nas the CIO. While potential can be difficult to assess, international shippingcompany, UPS, has a standardized way of assessing employees in four areas of\\nleadership —business, people, results, and self.

Explain your answer.\\n2. What are the risks to the company if they fail to create a succession plan?\\nADDITIONAL HUMAN RESOURCES FEATURES OF SAP ERP\\nHuman resources staff must keep pace with rapidly changing social, technological, and\\nlegislative developments that affect the corporate world. Because of that, the SAP Human\\nResources module has been expanded to include features that assist managers withhuman resources tasks that have only recently become important to corporations.\\nMobile Time Management\\nMany employees, especially sales personnel who spend a significant amount of time on the\\nroad, may not have regular access to a PC. SAP ’s Mobile Time Management tool allows\\nemployees to use smartphones or other mobile devices to record their working times,\\nrecord absences, or enter a leave request.\\nManagement of Family and Medical Leave\\nThe Human Resources module alleviates some of the administrative burden imposed by\\nthe federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. Companies can program the\\nHuman Resources module to determine whether an employee is eligible to take FMLAleave and to automatically deduct those absences from the employee ’s allowable leave.\\nManagement of Domestic Partner Benefits\\nMany companies provide benefits for domestic (unmarried) partners. The Human Resourcesmodule now supports the management of benefits for domestic partners and their children.The system provides companies more flexibility in customizing dependent coverage options\\nfor health plans, eligibility for enrollment of dependents, and designation of beneficiaries.\\nAdministration of Long-Term Incentives\\nAn outgrowth of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (discussed in Chapter 5) is that companies must\\naccount for the expected costs that will occur as a result of long-term employee incentives,177Human Resources Processes with ERP\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

The Human Resources module provides more options for processing\\nlong-term incentives. For instance, the SAP Payroll module enables companies to calculate\\ntaxes accurately when employees exercise stock options and sell their shares in the\\ncompany. The Human Resources module can be programmed to share that incentive datawith Accounting so that Accounting can complete the necessary financial reporting.\\nPersonnel Cost Planning\\nChanges in an organization (including expansions, acquisitions, and downsizing) can affect\\nemployee-related expenses, which are usually a significant portion of a company ’s costs. The\\nPersonnel Cost Planning tool allows human resources staff to define and evaluate planning\\nscenarios to generate cost estimates. Performing cost planning allows human resources to\\nforecast cost estimates by integrating data with other SAP ERP modules.\\nManagement and Payroll for Global Employees\\nCompanies who manage a team of employees around the globe face many complicated\\nissues, including managing relocation plans, visas and work permits, housing, taxes, andbonus pay in a variety of countries. SAP ERP has enhanced features to support the\\nmanagement of these issues, with customized functionality for over 50 countries —helping\\ncompanies ensure their payroll processes meet current legal regulations and collective\\nbargaining agreements in the local business environments.\\nManagement by Objectives\\nThe concept of management by objectives (MBO) was first outlined by Peter Drucker in his\\n1954 book The Practice of Management . In MBO, managers are encouraged to focus on\\nresults, not activities, and to “negotiate a contract of goals ”with their subordinates without\\ndictating the exact methods for achieving them. SAP ERP supports the MBO approachthrough a process that incorporates performance appraisal. The appraisal results can affect\\nan employee ’s compensation, generating annual pay raises that can be significant, depending\\non the employee ’s performance. The MBO process in SAP ERP also allows managers to\\ninclude the results of achieved objectives in the employee ’s qualifications profile.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nFMLA Management\\nUnder the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993, eligible employees can take up\\nto 12 weeks of unpaid time off per year to recover from a serious medical condition or tocare for a sick member of their immediate family or a new child. At Banner Health, acompany with hospitals and healthcare facilities in seven states, about 5 percent ofemployees make use of FMLA leave. The company has calculated the cost of that leaveat close to $1 million per year, not including the cost of regular sick days, vacations,bereavement leave, and so on. In fact, the Human Resources staff at Banner thinks thatcost estimate probably does not reflect leave taken by another 1 percent of employeeswhose time is not accurately tracked. Some absences are not tracked because they arenot documented properly. For example, if an employee takes time off for migraine\\n(continued)178Chapter 6\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

By tracking absences\\nwith human capital management software, employees might be encouraged to see\\nspecialist doctors sooner to get treatment that could reduce future absences.\\nPart of the challenge of documenting FMLA absences is the complexity of the task.\\nFirst, in addition to the FMLA, there are many state laws governing medical leave rights,such as the California Family Rights Act (CFRA). Second, the FMLA rules are complex.For example, the following is a small section of the FMLA that defines intermittent orreduced leave:\\nLeave under subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1) shall not be taken by an\\nemployee intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule unless the employee andthe employer of the employee agree otherwise. Subject to paragraph (2), subsection\\n(e)(2), and subsection (b)(5) or (f) (as appropriate) of section 103, leave under\\nsubparagraph (C) or (D) of subsection (a)(1) or under subsection (a)(3) may betaken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically necessary.\\nSubject to subsection (e)(3) and section 103(f), leave under subsection (a)(1)(E)\\nmay be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule. The taking of leaveintermittently or on a reduced leave schedule pursuant to this paragraph shall not\\nresult in a reduction in the total amount of leave to which the employee is entitled\\nunder subsection (a) beyond the amount of leave actually taken.\\nObviously, understanding and properly accounting for FMLA leave is complex.\\nSoftware to manage FMLA leaves, such as SAP ’s FMLA Workbench, can help companies\\ndo the following:\\n•Determine FMLA eligibility based on an employees hours worked and hire\\ndate.\\n•Track concurrent and intermittent FMLA leave simultaneously with otherleave types such as vacation or personal leave.\\n•Generate the necessary forms and documents for managing FMLA events.\\n•Store doctor ’s certifications and send alerts when new certifications are\\nrequired.\\n•Reduce the likelihood of Department of Labor investigations and employee\\nlawsuits.\\nThe last point is especially important for human resources professionals. In the\\nrecent legal case Narodetsky v. Cardone Industries , the court held that human\\nresources managers may be individually liable for FMLA violations at an organization.\\nQuestion:\\n1.

Adding to that\\ncomplexity is the fact that individuals with various skills and abilities are responsible for\\nexecuting business processes. For business processes to be effective (achieve the desiredresults) and efficient (achieve the desired results with the minimum use of resources), the\\nprocesses must be clearly defined, and individuals must be adequately trained to perform\\ntheir roles and to understand how their roles fit within the overall business process.\\nWe will use the term process model to describe any abstract representation of a\\nprocess. A process model can be as simple as a diagram with boxes and arrows or ascomplex as computer software that allows for process simulation. Graphicalrepresentations are usually easier to understand than written descriptions, and process-\\nmodeling tools provide a way to describe a business process so anyone viewing the model\\ncan easily understand the process. Frequently, process models are developed by a team ofemployees involved in the process. The interaction required to develop a process model\\noften reveals misunderstandings and ensures that all team members are “on the same\\npage. ”A well-developed process model provides a good starting point for analyzing a\\nprocess so participants can design and implement improvements. Process models can alsobe used to train employees who will support the business process.\\nFlowcharting Process Models\\nFlowcharts are the simplest of the process-modeling tools. A flowchart is any graphical\\nrepresentation of the movement or flow of concrete or abstract items —materials,\\ndocuments, logic, and so on. Flowcharts originated with mathematicians and computerprogrammers, who used them to trace the logical path of an algorithm. In the early days of\\ncomputer programming, computer resources were limited, and executing a programused considerable resources. As a result, most programmers spent a significant amount\\nof time clearly defining the logic of their programs using flowcharts before actually writing\\nthe code and testing the program.\\nA flowchart is a clear, graphical representation of a process from beginning to end,\\nregardless of whether that process is an algorithm or a manufacturing procedure.Flowcharting has been used in business applications since the 1960s to helpbusinesspeople visualize workflows and functional responsibility within organizations.\\nToday the term process mapping is often used interchangeably with flowcharting, the\\ndistinction being that process mapping refers specifically to the activities occurring within\\nanexisting business process. Process mapping develops an “as is ”representation of a\\nprocess, with a goal of exposing weaknesses that need to be addressed. Once a companydevelops a process map, it can perform a gap analysis, which is an assessment of\\ndisparities between how the process currently works and how the organization wants\\nit to work.\\nFlowcharting uses a standardized set of symbols to represent various business\\nactivities. You can use a wide range of symbols for process mapping, but the basic setshown in Figure 7-1 is sufficient to describe even a complicated business process. Using a\\nfew simple symbols places the focus on the process rather than on the tool used torepresent it.184Chapter 7\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

After Maria incurs travel\\nexpenses on her personal credit card, she completes a paper expense report, makes a copy\\nfor her records, attaches receipts for any expenses over $25, and mails the report to her\\nzone manager at the branch office. The manager, Kevin, reviews the report and eitherapproves it or mails it back to Maria with a note asking for an explanation, verification, or\\nmodification. Once Kevin approves the expense report, he mails it to the corporate office.\\nAfter the administrative assistant sorts the mail at the corporate office, she forwards theexpense report to the accounts payable (A/P) clerk, who performs a preliminary check of\\nthe report. The clerk contacts Kevin for any necessary clarification, then forwards the\\nexpense report to the expense report auditor, who reviews it. If there is a problem with thereport, the auditor mails it back to Maria, who revises it and returns it. Then the auditor\\nenters the report into Fitter ’s PC-based accounting system and files a hard copy with the\\nreceipts in a filing cabinet, organized by employee name.\\nAt the end of each week, an A/P clerk uses the PC-based accounting system to print\\npayroll checks, payments to suppliers, and expense reimbursement checks.

Without clearly defined boundaries, a project can expand to the\\npoint where it can become unmanageable. Many activities related to sales employeeexpenses are considered outside of the boundary of Fitter ’s expense-reporting process\\nmap. For example, Fitter might provide cash advances or issue corporate credit cards fortravel expenses. Employees might need to make reservations for air travel or hotels186Chapter 7\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

The company might require employees to use a\\npreferred hotel, or it might have specific policies regarding car rentals, including preferred\\nrental companies, approved car classes, insurance, and prepaid gas. While all of these\\nconsiderations are important and should be documented somewhere, the process mappedin Figure 7-2 is the expense-reporting process ; the process boundaries do not include\\nthese additional travel-related activities. Including these external considerations in theprocess map would greatly increase the size of the process-mapping project and putthe process-improvement project at risk. The complete process map for the expense-\\nreporting process begins after travel expenses have been incurred and ends with the\\nreceipt by the salesperson of a refund check. These starting and end points are the processboundaries for the expense-reporting process.\\nAll processes should have only one beginning point and one ending point. In Figure 7-2,\\nthe beginning process boundary is represented by the oval figure containing the text“Expenses incurred. ”Next, the process map shows four operation blocks that define the\\ntasks performed by the employee in completing the expense report. The number ofoperation blocks used and the level of detail in the descriptions are a matter of preferenceand depend on the purpose for which a process map is created. If the process map will be\\nused to improve a business process, and the members of the process-improvement team are\\nfamiliar with the process, then less detail is needed. In fact, too much detail could obscurethe key features of the process. On the other hand, if the process map will be used to\\ndocument the process for training new sales employees, more detail is required to ensure\\nthat new employees can use the process map to follow the process properly.\\nFigure 7-2 also contains one decision diamond. A decision diamond asks a question\\nthat can be answered with YesorNo. In this case, the decision diamond asks whether the\\nsales manager approves the expense report. There are only two possible options —Yesand\\nNo. It may tempting for the novice to create process maps with decision diamonds that\\nhave more than two outcomes; however, doing so can lead to confused logic. All businessprocesses can be defined using one or more decision diamonds, each with only twooutcomes.\\nFinally, because Figure 7-2 only shows part of the expense-reporting process, the\\nflowchart ends with a connector.

Generally, the task of mapping a process requires a team consisting of\\nkey personnel who are involved in the process. Frequently, the act of accuratelydescribing the process, and understanding how the functional areas interact, make it\\nobvious to the team what steps are necessary to improve the process. This is especially\\ntrue for organizations that have previously focused on functional responsibilities ratherthan business processes.\\nUsing the simple technique of value analysis can also generate process-improvement\\nideas. In value analysis , each activity in the process is analyzed for the value it adds to\\nthe product or service. The value added is an increase in a product ’s or service ’s value,\\nfrom the perspective of the customer. Activities can add:\\n\\x81Real value —Value for which the customer is willing to pay\\n\\x81Business value —Value that helps the company run its business\\n\\x81No value —An activity that should be eliminated\\nThe Fitter expense-reporting process does not provide real value, because Fitter ’s\\ncustomers do not care whether sales employees receive prompt and accurate\\nreimbursement of their business expenses. However, the expense-reporting process doesadd business value, and it should provide this value at a minimum cost. Determining thevalue of a good or service is easy— it is what someone is willing to pay for it. Evaluating\\nthe value of part of a business activity, however, is not an exact science because parts of aprocess cannot be sold on the open market. Although it is a challenging task, evaluatingeach activity on the basis of value provided can highlight opportunities for improvement.\\nActivities that cost more than their value added should be improved.\\nThe value analysis concept can be expanded to an evaluation of both the time and\\ncost of each process step. For each step in the current process, you estimate the actualtime and cost. Then you estimate the value-added time and cost— determining how much\\nof the actual time is adding value and how much of the cost is worth paying for.\\nWe will use the “Mail expense report ”function of Fitter ’s expense-reporting process to\\nillustrate value analysis. This function could cost upwards of $50, including not just the\\ncost of the envelope and postage, but also the time spent by the salesperson to mail theexpense report. The value analysis includes the elapsed time for mailing the expense\\nreport, including the time it takes the salesperson to find a mailbox, the time the\\npostal service takes to deliver the expense report to the company headquarters, and thetime it takes the company ’s internal mail system to deliver the expense report to the\\nsales manager.\\nSuppose that for Fitter the elapsed time is typically three days. To perform value\\nanalysis, you would determine how much of this time and cost is value added. To\\ndetermine this value, you must view the activity “Mail expense report ”in terms of what is\\nactually being accomplished. In this case, it is not the physical transmission of paper that\\nmatters. Mailing the expense report is a means to transmit expense data and\\ndocumentation. Email could minimize the time and cost required to transmit that data;\\ntherefore, mailing an expense report at a cost of $50, to arrive in three days, is onlyproviding value worth pennies (which is the cost to send an email) in a function that\\ncould be executed within seconds. Looking at the current time and cost of each process197Process Modeling, Process Improvement, and ERP Implementation\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

H. James Harrington, in his book Business Process Improvement , suggests that\\ncompanies ask the following questions about their business processes to identify areas for\\nimprovement:\\n\\x81Arethere unnecessary checks and balances?\\n\\x81Does the activity inspect or approve someone else ’s work?\\n\\x81Does it require more than one signature?\\n\\x81Are multiple copies required?\\n\\x81Are copies stored for no apparent reason?\\n\\x81Are copies sent to people who do not need the information?\\n\\x81Is there unnecessary written correspondence?\\n\\x81Are there people or agencies involved that impede the effectiveness and\\nefficiency of the process?\\n\\x81Do existing organizational procedures regularly impede the efficient,\\neffective, and timely performance of duties?\\n\\x81Is someone approving something they already approved (for example,\\napproving capital expenditures that were approved as part of a budget)?\\n\\x81Is the same information being collected at more than one time or location?\\n\\x81Are duplicate databases being maintained?\\nHarrington also suggests using the following approaches to improving processes:\\n\\x81Perform activities in parallel (for example, approvals).\\n\\x81Change the sequence of activities.\\n\\x81Reduce interruptions.\\n\\x81Avoid duplication or fragmentation of tasks.\\n\\x81Avoid complex flows and bottlenecks.\\n\\x81Combine similar activities.\\n\\x81Reduce the amount of handling.\\n\\x81Eliminate unused data.\\n\\x81Eliminate copies.\\nEvaluating Process Improvement Prior to Implementation\\nWhile identifying process improvements can be difficult, implementing them is even morechallenging. Disrupting the current process to make changes can be costly and time\\nconsuming, and managers are frequently reluctant to risk trying process-improvement\\nideas —especially if the ideas require a significant change in the way an activity is\\ncompleted. One way to mitigate this risk is to use dynamic process modeling to evaluate\\nprocess changes before they are implemented. Dynamic process modeling takes a basic\\nprocess flowchart and puts it into motion, using computer simulation techniques to\\nfacilitate the evaluation of proposed process changes. Computer simulation repeatedly\\ngenerates random variables (such as customer orders) that interact with a logical model of\\nthe business process to predict the performance of the actual system. A dynamic processmodel can estimate the performance of a system, using measures such as cycle time (how\\nlong the process takes), productivity, total cost, idle time, and bottlenecks.198Chapter 7\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

It is a business responsibility. Business users within an organization must agree onwhat the old business processes are before the organization can begin to think about\\nadopting —and automating —new business processes. That is exactly what happened with\\nthe Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB).\\nThe RPSGB is the professional body for pharmacist professionals in Great Britain.\\nThe RPSGB ’s responsibilities include investigating complaints against pharmacists and\\npharmacy technicians, and recommending criminal prosecutions, when appropriate.\\nThe RPSGB ’s business process management project began in response to challenges\\nthe organization was experiencing with the Access database system that handled\\ncomplaints. By 2006, the database could no longer effectively handle the volume ofcomplaints the RPSGB was receiving, so the organization established a team to introducenew software to help manage its complaint process. Initially, the team could not decidewhich processes the new software should automate. Team members also disagreed onwhat level of automation was required and on what type of documentation needed to bemaintained. Therefore, the team decided they needed to define the organization ’s\\ncurrent business processes before determining how to make the complaint managementprocess more efficient. The team created various process maps to develop a graphicrepresentation of the existing processes.\\nThe complaint process begins when a complaint is filed against a pharmacist. For\\nexample, complaints might be triggered by a rude pharmacist or, more seriously, by adrunk pharmacist dispensing the wrong medication. Some types of complaints requirespecific actions, which were documented with the process map.\\nOnly after the team had mapped all the current processes and identified ways to\\nmake them more efficient was software applied to automate those processes. The teamalso worked with the British government to ensure the new processes had the flexibilityto be changed quickly if new rules governing the pharmaceutical industry were passedin Parliament.\\nThe entire project took almost two years to complete. During that time, the RPSGB\\nfocused considerable energy on change management to convince those involved thatchanging the processes was worthwhile. In this case, many employees were more easilyconvinced of the merits of the project because legislation that would require certainprocess changes was due to be passed shortly. The new automated system greatlyreduced the RPSGB ’s dependence on paper, and it helped the organization achieve its\\ngoal of having 80 percent of all cases requiring further action being filed with theorganization ’s Investigation Committee within three months of the completion of the\\ninitial investigation.\\nQuestions:\\n1. Why is it important to understand your current business processes before\\ntrying to improve them?\\n2. Why might it be difficult for a group of workers to come to an agreement\\nabout what their current business processes are?199Process Modeling, Process Improvement, and ERP Implementation\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

For example, the sales\\norder process is fundamental to a manufacturing business; the salespeople, sales orderclerks, warehouse managers, accounts receivable clerks, and others spend most of their\\nday supporting the process. If the process is efficiently designed and managed, and the\\nemployees are properly trained, workers will experience enough repetition to becomeefficient in their daily tasks.\\nSome business processes, however, are performed only sporadically. Often, such\\nprocesses are inefficient, especially when the processes involve more than one functionalarea. Work may “fall through the cracks, ”not necessarily through negligence, but due to a\\nlack of repetition. For example, the process of establishing credit limits may occur onlyoccasionally and may require coordination between the Sales Department, whichidentifies new customers and gathers basic data (contact names, addresses, contract terms\\nand conditions) and the Accounts Receivable Department, which evaluates a customer ’s\\ncredit history to establish a credit limit. Unless employees manage the process of\\nestablishing a credit limit properly, a new customer ’s order may be blocked for an\\nunacceptable length of time. For sporadic processes such as this, a workflow software toolcan help employees avoid “dropping the ball ”by providing tools for tracking and\\nmonitoring the tasks in the project and providing reminders to the employees involved.\\nWorkflow tools are software programs that automate the execution of business\\nprocesses and address all aspects of a process, including the process flow (the logical stepsin the business process), the people involved (the organization), and the effects (the\\nprocess information that documents the process steps). ERP software provides a workflow\\nmanagement system that supports and speeds up business processes. It enables employeesto carry out complex business processes and track the current status of a process at\\nany time.\\nThe SAP ERP workflow tool, called SAP Business Workflow, links employees to the\\nbusiness transactions that need to be performed. In a normal business process, anemployee uses his or her knowledge to determine what transactions to process at what\\ntimes. Sometimes this work is triggered by an external source, such as a customer callthat causes the sales order clerk to perform the sales order creation transaction. In other\\ncases, an employee uses a reporting tool to determine what transactions need to be\\nprocessed. For example, as discussed in Chapter 5, industrial credit management isimplemented by blocking sales orders when there is a credit issue. The blocked sales\\norder report (shown in Figure 5-7) is the report that an employee can use to decide what\\ntransactions must be processed to resolve the credit issue.\\nIn the case of sporadic processes, the SAP Business Workflow tool proactively\\nconnects employees with business transactions using SAP ’s internal email system and\\nworkflow tasks , which are email messages that can include basic information, notes, and\\ndocuments, as well as direct links to business transactions. The SAP system can monitor\\nworkflow tasks, and if the tasks are not completed on time, the workflow system can\\nautomatically take various actions, including changing the workflow task priority andsending email reminders to the employees responsible for the work.200Chapter 7\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

The process of\\nrequesting time off is likely a relatively infrequent process that can create operational and\\nemployee morale problems if not handled properly.

Implementation was particularly challenging in the late 1990s, as many firms rushed\\nto implement ERP systems to avoid the Y2K problem. The explosive growth in demand for ERP\\nimplementations at that time caused a significant shortage of experienced consultants. Since2000, the pace of implementations has slowed considerably. Most Fortune 500 firms have203Process Modeling, Process Improvement, and ERP Implementation\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The current growth area in ERP implementations is in the small\\nto midsized business market, and vendors have been developing products, including Microsoft\\nDynamics and SAP Business One, tailored to this market.\\nRecall that the implementation of ERP is an ongoing process, not a one-time task.\\nERP systems are extremely complicated, and no company ever takes full advantage of allthe capabilities in a system. Because of the challenges in the initial implementation of an\\nERP system, many firms limit the scope of the implementation projects to only what isabsolutely necessary to operate the business, and rightly so. After the implementation\\nis complete and the system is running smoothly, many firms seek to further improve\\ntheir business processes by updating and expanding upon their original ERP systemimplementation. These follow-on implementation projects, while smaller than the initial\\nERP implementation, still require effective management.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nBusiness Process Improvement at Multi-Chem\\nWhat do you do when your organization grows so rapidly that documents start to fall through\\nthe cracks? Smart companies turn to business process management to help them get theirorganizations running more efficiency. Multi-Chem, an international specialty chemicalscompany selling to the oil and gas industry, did just that in an attempt to improve its businessprocesses. The company is based in San Angelo, Texas, and has over 700 employees. Due toits rapid growth, the company ’s document approval processes had become slow and\\nineffective. Documents, such as vacation requests, were only trickling through an inefficientapproval process and some were even languishing on workers ’desks.\\nBefore setting out to improve this inefficient business process, Multi-Chem ’s\\nmanagement established some criteria for the solution. The company wanted a programthat was more than a simple email system; the solution had to be able to managedocuments electronically, and it needed to be able to control the processes ’workflow.\\nManagement also wanted to put the system in the user ’s hands, that is, they did not want\\na system that the IT Department would have to manage on a daily basis. In addition, thesolution needed to be scalable since the company was growing fast.\\nThe solution chosen by Multi-Chem was BP Logix ’s Process Director. Internally,\\nMulti-Chem refers to the new system as eDocs. The company focused first on creating anew personnel request form, which is used for new hires and new positions. With thenew system, Multi-Chem was able to design a user-friendly form that simplified thehiring process, and because the new form and process was so intuitive, it was widelyaccepted by employees. And through the system ’s use of audit trails, tracking\\nauthorizations has been simplified. Further implementation phases included thedevelopment of new documents and workflows for approving capital expenditures,training employees, and creating customer profiles.\\nMulti-Chem ’s eDocs system continues to save the company money and time. All\\nemployees are using eDocs, and the system has become a critical part of their work.\\nQuestion:\\n1. Think of an example of a paper-based inefficient business process, such as one\\nyou might see at a traditional doctor ’s office. How could an electronic\\ndocument system that uses workflow improve the efficiency of that process?204Chapter 7\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The costs of an ERP\\nimplementation include the following:\\n\\x81Software licensing fees— ERP software is quite expensive, and most ERP\\nvendors charge annual license fees based on the number of users.\\n\\x81Consulting fees— ERP implementations require the use of consultants with\\nthe skills to configure the software to support the company ’s business\\nprocesses. Good consultants have extensive experience in the way ERP\\nsystems function in practice, and they can help companies make decisions\\nthat avoid excessive data input, while capturing the information necessary to\\nmake managerial decisions.\\n\\x81Project team member time —ERP projects require key people within the\\ncompany to guide the implementation. These are team members who havedetailed knowledge of the company ’s business. They work closely with the\\nconsultants to make sure the configuration of the ERP software supports the\\ncompany ’s needs, which means these workers are frequently taken away\\nfrom their daily responsibilities.\\n\\x81Employee training —Project team members need training in the ERP software\\nso they can work successfully with the consultants in the implementation.\\nThose team members also frequently work with training consultants todevelop and deliver company-specific training programs for all employees.\\n\\x81Productivity losses —No matter how smoothly an ERP implementation goes,\\ncompanies normally lose productivity during the first weeks and months afterswitching to a new ERP system.\\nTo justify the costs associated with an ERP system, a company must identify a\\nsignificant financial benefit that will be generated by the use of the software, but the only\\nway a company can save money with an ERP system is by using it to support moreefficient and effective business processes. This means that an implementation project\\nshould not just re-create the company ’s current processes and information systems,\\nalthough that is a possibility since SAP provides the source code with its ERP package.\\nA company could choose to alter the package through SAP ’s internal programming\\nlanguage, called Advanced Business Application Programming (ABAP) —which you first\\nlearned about in Chapter 2. With access to the SAP ERP source code, it is possible for acompany to spend a significant sum of money on software code development to avoid\\nchanging a business process to the best practice process designed into the ERP software.\\nMany companies have difficultly handling change and prefer to continue doing business asthey always have —rather than adopting the best practices built into the ERP system.\\nAs part of the implementation, a company must also manage the transfer of data from\\nits old computer system to the new ERP system. In addition to managing master data suchas materials data, customer data, vendor data, and so on, a company must also transfer\\ntransaction data, which includes sales orders and purchase orders, many of which are\\nlikely to be in various stages of processing —a challenging task.205Process Modeling, Process Improvement, and ERP Implementation\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

An ERP system\\nchanges how people work, and for the system to be effective, the change may have to bedramatic, going beyond the way employees interact with the software to the way they\\nperform their tasks. Furthermore, business processes that are more effective require fewer\\npeople. Some employees will no longer be needed. It is no small thing to ask people toparticipate in a process that may not only change their day-to-day activities, but could\\nalso eliminate their current jobs.\\nManaging the human behavior aspects of organizational change is called\\norganizational change management (OCM) . Do not underestimate the importance of this\\naspect of the implementation process. One of the keys to managing OCM is to realize that\\nmost people do not mind change, they mind being changed. If the ERP implementation\\nis a project that is being forced on the employees, they will resist it. If employees view it\\nas a chance to make the company more efficient and effective by improving business\\nprocesses —and if these process improvements will make the company more profitable\\nand therefore provide more job security —there is a greater likelihood that employees will\\nsupport the implementation efforts. As mentioned earlier, the best way to improve abusiness process is to have the people most familiar with the process leverage theirexperience and creativity to develop process-improvement ideas. When employees have\\ncontributed to a process change, they have a sense of ownership and will be more likely to\\nsupport the change.\\nImplementation Tools\\nMany tools are available to help manage implementation projects. Process mapping,described previously, is perhaps the most critical. For an ERP implementation to go\\nsmoothly and provide value, it is critical that a company understand both its current\\nprocesses and the desired state of the processes after implementation.\\nSAP provides Solution Manager, a set of tools and information that helps companies\\nmanage the implementation of SAP ERP. In Solution Manager, the ERP implementation\\nproject is presented in an Implementation Roadmap, consisting of the following fivephases:\\n\\x81Project Preparation (15 to 20 days)\\n\\x81Business Blueprint (25 to 40 days)\\n\\x81Realization (55 to 80 days)\\n\\x81Final Preparation (35 to 55 days)\\n\\x81Go Live and Support (20 to 24 days)\\nFigure 7-17 shows an example of this roadmap. The left side of the Solution\\nManager screen shows a hierarchical menu structure that organizes each step in the\\nimplementation, and on the right side of the screen are the detailed items, thedescriptions, documents, white papers, tools, and so on to support each step.206Chapter 7\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Some of the\\ntasks in the Project Preparation phase include organizing the technical team, defining the\\nsystem landscape (the computer servers, networking hardware, and peripherals necessary\\nto operate the ERP system), selecting the hardware and database vendors, and mostimportantly, defining the project ’s scope —what the project is to accomplish. A common\\nproblem in ERP implementations is scope creep , which is the unplanned expansion of the\\nproject ’s goals and objectives. Scope creep causes the project to go over time and over\\nbudget and increases the risk of an unsuccessful implementation. Defining the project ’s\\nscope ahead of time helps prevent this problem.\\nIn the second phase, Business Blueprint, project team members produce detailed\\ndocumentation of the business process requirements of the company. The Business\\nBlueprint phase results in a detailed description of how the company intends to run its\\nbusiness with the SAP ERP system. Process mapping is critical in the Business Blueprintphase. The results of the Business Blueprint phase will guide consultants and project team\\nmembers in configuring the SAP ERP system (which occurs in the third phase). During the\\nBusiness Blueprint phase, technical team members determine the method of data transferfrom the firm ’s existing computer systems (called legacy systems), which may be replaced\\nby the ERP system or may continue to function with the ERP system through an interface.207Process Modeling, Process Improvement, and ERP Implementation\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.In the Realization phase (the third phase), the project team members work with\\nconsultants to configure the ERP software in the development system. In an SAP\\nimplementation, a company uses three separate SAP systems over the course of the\\nimplementation process —a development system for configuring the SAP software to match\\nthe Business Blueprint, a test (or quality assurance ) system for evaluating the software\\nconfiguration, and a production system, on which the company runs the final software.The team also develops any necessary ABAP code or other tools (such as third-partysoftware packages) and creates the required connections to the legacy systems.\\nThe fourth phase, Final Preparation, is critical to the success of the implementation\\nproject. Tasks in this phase include:\\n\\x81Testing the system throughput for critical business processes (determining\\nwhether it can handle the volume of transactions) in the quality assurancesystem\\n\\x81Setting up the help desk where end users can get support\\n\\x81Setting up operation of the production system and transferring data fromlegacy systems\\n\\x81Conducting end-user training\\n\\x81Setting the Go Live date\\nWhen scope creep occurs in a project, it is commonly not discovered until well into\\ntheRealization phase, when the team begins to miss deadlines, and the costs begin to\\nexceed the budget. By the time the scope creep is discovered and its impact is understood,there is often little management can do to correct the problem, as most of the time andbudget have been spent. In some cases, management chooses to shorten or omit the Final\\nPreparation phase, which means that testing of the system and training of employees are\\nreduced or eliminated. Unfortunately, with reduced testing, errors in configuring thesystem may not be discovered until it is put into use. Likewise, with reduced training,\\nemployees may not know how to use the system properly, which can create a complicated\\nchain of problems, due to the integrated nature of the system. Any cost savings gained byshortening the Final Preparation phase are often overshadowed by productivity losses and\\nconsulting fees in the Go Live and Support phase.\\nIn the fifth and final phase, Go Live and Support, the company begins using the new\\nERP system. Wise managers try to schedule the Go Live date for a period when thecompany is least busy. A properly staffed help desk is critical for the success of the Go\\nLive phase because users have the most questions during the first few weeks of workingwith a new system. The SAP ERP project team members and consultants should be\\nscheduled to work the help desk during the first few weeks of the Go Live period.\\nAlthough significant testing of the system and settings should have been done\\nthroughout the project, it is not possible to test all the settings and thoroughly evaluatethe throughput of the system. Therefore, monitoring of the system during the Go Live and\\nSupport phase is critical so changes can be made quickly if the performance of the systemis not satisfactory. Finally, it is important to set a completion date for the project. Any\\nenhancements or extensions to the system should be managed as separate projects, not as\\nextensions of the original implementation project.208Chapter 7\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

For instance, in the aftermath of the Haitian earthquake disaster in January2010, many containers of medical supplies sat at airports, unable to reach theirdestination. With its online network, which is built on a foundation of SAP software,Direct Relief was able to supply victims of the earthquake with over $50 million insupport —due to the organization ’s close attention to supply chain and logistics details.\\nDirect Relief initially implemented some SAP ERP modules in 2008, with a second\\nphase in 2010. In the second stage, a new online community network interface was builtusing SAP ’s NetWeaver Portal. In addition, SAP ’s CRM, BusinessObjects, and Business\\nWarehouse tools were used to create the online network, which brings donationstogether with need. Direct Relief ’s goal was to bring the efficiency of a profit-oriented\\ncompany to its nonprofit organization. After users are registered and screened, they canlog on to a secure portal to donate medicine and volunteer medical services. Thoserequesting aid can do the same to determine what supplies and services are available.The network was initially rolled out to users in the United States only; however, the newsystem was so successful that it has since been expanded to 70 countries.\\nAccording to Direct Relief ’s President and CEO, Thomas Tighe, the nonprofit has\\nbeen “able to increase the flow of aid provided, help more people at a lower cost, and\\nproduce more precise reporting,” all of which helps the organization match the needs of\\na particular group to that of a supplier of that required product or service. The newsystem also proved it is scalable. During the Haiti earthquake crisis, donations madethrough the network doubled in a two-week period, and over the course of a few days,the number of system users (donating and supplying) grew by 300 percent.\\nRoss Comstock, the IT director, also explains how the new system is highly user-\\nfriendly, “Because our product donors are offering products that are in many cases\\nalready in our warehouse, we decided to adapt the e-commerce functionality to have itface upstream as well— so we can take product donations through it, which I think is\\npretty innovative. ”The efficiency of running a real-time system with a single database\\nand integrated processes has paid off in helping those in need.\\nQuestions:\\n1.

In this system landscape, there are three completely separate SAP systems,\\ndesignated as Development (DEV), Quality Assurance (QAS), and Production (PROD).\\nTransport directoryQAS DEV PROD\\nSource Line: Course Technology/Cengage Learning.\\nFIGURE 7-18 System landscape for SAP ERP implementation\\nTheDevelopment (DEV) system is used to develop configuration settings for the\\nsystem, as well as special enhancements using ABAP code. These changes are\\nautomatically recorded in the transport directory , which is a special data file location on\\nthe DEV server. Changes recorded in the DEV system are imported into the Quality\\nAssurance (QAS) system , where they are tested to make sure they function properly. If\\nany corrections are needed, they are made in the DEV system and then transported againto the QAS system for testing. Once the configuration settings and ABAP programs pass\\ntesting in the QAS system, all settings, programs, and changes are transported to the\\nProduction (PROD) system , which is the system the company will use to run its business\\nprocesses.\\nThe use of separate systems is important during the initial implementation of an SAP\\nERP system, and it is even more important after the Go Live phase. All software packageshave occasional updates, and having systems available to test these updates before\\napplying them to a Production system can prevent problems. If a company wants to\\nuse features of the SAP ERP system that were not included in the initial projectimplementation, then the company should have a process like the one SAP provides\\nto manage future changes to the production system in a controlled fashion.210Chapter 7\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Process modeling is a fundamental tool forunderstanding and analyzing business processes.\\n\\x81Process mapping is a process-modeling tool that uses graphical representations to documentbusiness processes. Other process-modeling methodologies include hierarchical modeling,\\ndeployment flowcharting, and event process chain (EPC) diagramming. Value analysis is a\\ntechnique that can be used to generate process-improvement ideas, and dynamic process\\nmodeling uses software to evaluate process improvements prior to implementation.\\n\\x81ERP Workflow tools provide the ability to monitor and facilitate sporadic business\\nprocesses so important work does not “fall through the cracks. ”\\n\\x81Most challenges to ERP implementation involve managing personnel and their reactions tothe change, rather than managing technical issues.

This form is\\nsubmitted to the registration office where it is fed into a document reader, whichelectronically reads the completed forms; the data is then written to the master course\\nschedule disk.\\n\\x81At the end of the two-week registration period, data from the master course schedule\\ndisk is fed into the master scheduling program, which assigns students to courses. The\\nscheduling program is designed to maximize the number of students who receive their\\nrequested courses while staying within class capacity limits. Once the masterscheduling program has been updated for all students, the program produces three\\ndocuments: (1) individual schedules for each student, (2) initial student lists for each\\nclass, and (3) the summary schedule report for the administration.\\n\\x81After students receive their schedules, they are allowed to drop or add classes for a\\nperiod of two weeks. To add or drop a class, a student must first obtain permission\\nfrom the professor teaching the class. Once that signature is obtained on the drop/add\\nform, the student brings the form to the computer center where the clerk enters the\\nchange into the scheduling system, which in turn updates the master course disk. The\\nclerk then prints out a new schedule for that student.\\n2. Develop a swimlane process map for the online ordering process for Active Bicycle\\nCompany, shown below. Each of the following functions should be one swimlane: sales,\\naccounting, warehouse, and shipping.\\n\\x81The process begins when a customer submits an online order form to Active Bicycle\\nviathe Web. The customer supplies his or her name, address, email address, model\\nnumber of the bicycle they desire, and credit card number.\\n\\x81When the customer clicks on the Confirm button on the Web page, Active Bicycle ’s\\nsystem gets approval for the transaction from the credit card company. If the credit\\ncharge is approved, the system assigns a number to the sales order, displays an ordersummary for the customer to print, and sends a confirmation email to the customer. If thecredit charge is denied, the customer is asked to provide a different form of payment.\\n\\x81The system then generates a two-part invoice, a stock release form, and a two-partpacking slip form. The stock release form is sent to the Warehouse Department, and\\nthe two-part packing slip and one copy of the invoice are sent to the Shipping\\nDepartment. The other copy of the invoice is maintained in a holding file in the\\nAccounting Department to be filed later with the shipping certificate.\\n\\x81In the warehouse, employees use the stock release form to pull the appropriate\\ninventory to fill the order. Assuming there is enough stock (for the purposes of this\\nexercise you can assume there is enough stock), the bicycle is packed into a special\\nbox for shipping, with added protection so it will not be damaged in transit. Using the\\nstock release form, the warehouse staff inputs data into the inventory management\\nprogram to update the master inventory file. The warehouse clerk also must take theinformation from the stock release form and manually fill out a shipping certificate,\\nwhich is sent to the Accounting Department for a further check that the items are being\\nreleased from the warehouse. The boxed inventory, along with the packing slip, is thensent to the Shipping Department.\\n\\x81In the Shipping Department, one copy of the two-part packing slip is placed in theshipping department ’s file cabinet, and one is included with the goods to be sent to the\\ncustomer.212Chapter 7\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Develop a process map for the following request-for-quote process:\\n\\x81Your company assembles affordable washing machines from purchased parts. Your\\ncustomers buy in bulk from you and then relabel the washing machines with their own\\nbrand. Customers typically want unique features for their washers, and they often\\nsubmit a request for new features or other design changes, which results in a new\\nmodel being created. Customers initiate the new design process by submitting a\\nrequest for quotation (RFQ), which is a document that provides all the details for thenew washing machine model, including the quantity to be ordered. Your company\\nresponds to the RFQ with a written quote, which details the cost for an order that\\nwould meet the requirements of the RFQ. Many different departments, as well as themanufacturers of the washing machine component parts, are involved in creating\\nthe quote. The Sales Department must work closely with the Costing Department, the\\nProcurement Department, and the Assembly Department to provide a competitivequote to the customer. Create a swimlane flowchart to document the flow of\\ninformation between departments and external partners in creating the quote, using\\nthe following information:\\n\\x81The following internal departments are involved in the RFQ process:\\n\\x81Sales— Receives the customer ’s request for a price quote; creates the final quote\\nand sends it to the customer.\\n\\x81Assembly —Prepares production documents that detail the labor, tools, and\\nequipment required to produce the new washing machine.\\n\\x81Procurement —Creates RFQs for vendors for any new components needed for\\nthe new design.\\n\\x81Costing (Accounting) —Computes the final cost estimate.\\n\\x81The following external parties are involved in the RFQ process:\\n\\x81Customer —Submits a request for a price quote; receives the completed RFQ.\\n\\x81Vendor —Receives the request for a quote on the cost of component parts,\\ncomputes their costs, and submits a bid.\\n4.

Candidatesinterview with the hiring manager and with a Human Resources staff member. Human\\nResources records the interviews in an applicant flow log.\\n\\x81Once a candidate is selected for hire, Human Resources and the hiring manager\\nprepare an offer, and a background check on the candidate is initiated. Then, the hiring\\nmanager must approve the offer and obtain the required approval signatures on a joboffer approval form. Subsequently, the hiring manager extends the offer verbally to thecandidate, while Human Resources sends the written offer, including an employment\\nstart date. Once the applicant accepts the offer, a drug screening is scheduled for the\\ncandidate, who must also sign the offer letter and return it to Human Resources. Atthat point, Human Resources notifies the hiring manager of the candidate ’s\\nacceptance. Finally, if the drug test comes back negative, the new employeecompletes new-hire orientation on the first day of work.\\nFor Further Study and Research\\nBonneau, Lauren. “Direct Relief Brings Technology from the Commercial World to the\\nHumanitarian World. ”insiderProfiles , 2, no. 4 (October 2011): 24 –29.\\nCordes, Ronald M. “Flowcharting: The Essential Tool of Quality. ”Quality Digest .

An RFID device,\\nwhich can be attached to products, is a small package (or tag) made up of a\\nmicroprocessor and an antenna. The location of an item with an RFID tag can bedetermined using an RFID reader, which emits radio waves and receives signals backfrom the tag. The reader is also sometimes called an interrogator because it\\n“interrogates ”the tag. Because microprocessors have continued to become more\\npowerful and less expensive over time, the cost of RFID technology is approaching a level\\nat which it is becoming inexpensive enough to be cost-effective for many businesses.\\nToday, most materials are still tracked using bar codes and bar-code readers. However,\\nbar-code labels can degrade in bad weather, and an employee must point a bar-codereader directly at a bar code to read it. RFID technology does not need this line-of-sight\\nconnection, and can withstand most environmental stresses.\\nWalmart has been on the leading edge of the move to integrate RFID technology\\ninto the supply chain. In 2003, Walmart announced that it would require its top100 suppliers to begin tagging pallets and cases with RFID tags, which would allow\\nWalmart to more efficiently track products through its logistics network. (A Walmart-sponsored report from the University of Arkansas ’Information Technology Research\\nInstitute concluded that RFID reduced retail out-of-stock situations in storesby 16 percent.) However, by early 2007 reports began to surface that Walmart ’s RFID\\ninitiative was not progressing as planned. Although Walmart publicly denied that it was\\nexperiencing any issues with its RFID technology, by October 2007, the company\\nannounced a major change in its RFID strategy, shifting its focus to the use of RFIDs inits stores rather than in its distribution centers. Unfortunately, Walmart still faced the\\nreality that the cost for RFID tags was still too high to put on individual items, even\\nthough that is the area from which the biggest benefit would come. The majoropportunity for RFID technology to reduce out-of-stock situations is not in the supply\\nchain between the manufacturer and the storeroom at the individual store, but between\\nthe backroom stock area and the store shelves.\\nWalmart initiated its third RFID initiative in July 2010, announcing that it would\\nbegin requiring suppliers to place removable RFID smart tags on individual apparel items.According to Raul Vazquez, the executive in charge of Walmart stores in the westernUnited States, the “ability to wave the wand and have a sense of all the products that are\\non the floor or in the backroom in seconds is something that we feel can really transformour business. ”The potential return on investment of technologies that can improve216Chapter 8\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

A story may have 100 pairs of blue jeans on display\\nracks, but if there is not a pair in a customer ’s size, then a sale is not possible. A 2007\\npilot project at American Apparel Inc. resulted in sales increases of 14.3 percent in stores\\nthat using RFID technology. Garment-level RFID tags also have the potential to reduce\\nemployee theft by making it easier to check stockroom inventory and determine what\\nitems are missing.\\nPharmaceutical firms are also evaluating the use of RFID technology to comply with\\nrequirements to combat counterfeit drugs. Regulatory agencies such as the FDA aredeveloping rules that would require companies to track pharmaceutical products downto the package level. California is leading t his trend with their ePedigree law that will\\ntake effect on a staggered basis from January 1, 2015, through July 1, 2017. AnePedigree is an electronic record that contains information regarding each transaction inthe supply chain that results in a change of ownership of the given prescription drug,\\nfrom initial manufacturer to returns from retailers. To accomplish this, manufacturers\\nm u s tc r e a t eau n i q u es e r i a ln u m b e rf o rt h es m a l l e s tp a c k a g es i z et h a tc a nb es o l dt oaconsumer.\\nRFID technology is also being employed to track medical devices. For example,\\nSpectrum Health ’s Meijer Heart Center is using RFID technology to track stents —wire\\nmesh tubes that are implanted into weakened or narrowed cardiac arteries to keep them\\nopen. The Meijer Heart Center implants thousands of stents each year, and managing the\\ninventory of stents is challenging. Stents are small, but can cost up to $2,000 each. Inaddition, stents have an expiration date. In the past, manual systems were used to manage\\nstents, a time-consuming process that was error prone. Inventory accuracy in the old\\nsystem was 95 percent accurate —a figure that might sound good at first glance, but not\\nwhen you consider that if the heart center handles 2,000 stents per year (at $2,000 each),\\na 5 percent inventory error becomes a $200,000 problem.\\nWith the new system, stents are stored in RFID-enabled cabinets. Attached to each\\nstent is an RFID tag, which provides it with a unique identification number. To withdrawa stent for use, a nurse swipes his or her ID card to a device attached to the cabinet.\\nThrough the device, the nurse can then access a list of patients in the hospital database.The nurse identifies the patient requiring the stent, and the cabinet unlocks. Then all the\\nnurse has to do is remove the required stents from the cabinet; the RFID technology\\ntracks which stents have been removed for the patient. In addition to tracking theremoval of inventory, the system sends the information on the stents used to the\\nhospital ’s information system for patient billing. The system also monitors inventory levels\\nand triggers an order for new stents when necessary. If some of the stents that were\\nremoved for a patient are not used, the nurse can return the stents to the cabinet, and the\\nRFID device will automatically credit the patient ’s account. The system also tracks\\nexpiration dates so employees can make sure those stents are used before their expiration\\ndate. With the new RFID cabinet system, Spectrum ’s inventory accuracy for stent\\ninventory is now nearly 100 percent.217RFID, Business Intelligence (BI), Mobile Computing, and the Cloud\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

Eventually, Charney built American Apparel\\ninto a vertically integrated fashion company that makes its clothing in Los Angeles\\nrather than importing it from manufacturers in low-wage countries. In addition tomanufacturing its own clothes, American Apparel designs its own garments, which itsells through a network of company-owned stores. The company also creates all of itsadvertising and marketing materials (which are known for generating heatedcontroversy).\\nHowever, while the American Apparel was cultivating a hip image in the world of\\nretail, it was also developing a reputation for being soft on shoplifting. Former employeesallege that managers were asked to turn a blind eye to shoplifting so the “right type of\\nperson ”would be wearing American Apparel clothing. In addition, lax internal controls\\nover shipping and delivery combined with young store employees allegedly hired morefor their looks than for their management ability led to high levels of employee theft. Inan initial trial of RFID tags on garments in 2007, American Apparel found that inventory“shrinkage ”—a reduction in inventory due to human error, theft, or damage —was\\n20 percent, double the retail industry average. Employee theft was clearly a significantportion of this high level of shrinkage.\\nWhile reducing theft is an important part of American Apparel’ s RFID initiative,\\nimproved customer service is the primary goal. With RFID, American Apparel can use acontinuous replenishment process to ensure on-shelf availability of their products. RFIDalso improves on-the-rack availability and inventory control at American Apparel byreducing mistaken identity. Many of American Apparel ’s styles look similar, and\\nmanually inputting inventory data increases inventory accuracy problems. Stores withthe RFID technology now have inventory accuracy above 99 percent, and in manystores, the RFID technology has paid for itself within 6 months, based on inventory costsavings. “We measure everything, and have accountability of every item. Every item\\ncounts, and when we change that culture, employees start treating products better, ”says\\nStacey Shulman, American Apparel ’s vice president of technology. On February 8, 2012,\\nAmerican Apparel reported that it intends to equip all of its 285 stores with RFIDtechnology.\\nQuestions:\\n1. RFID technology allows a company to more accurately track employee\\nperformance —from mistakes in inventory handling to theft. How would you\\nfeel about working at a company that used RFID technology to monitor yourperformance? Do you think this use of technology is good for a company ’s\\nculture?\\n2. In what other industries might RFID technology have an impact similar to that\\nseen at American Apparel?218Chapter 8\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

While this data plays a fundamental role in the day-to-day operations of a business, it also provides an opportunity for a company to perform\\nsophisticated analyses to determine ways to improve its business. Business intelligence (BI) ,\\nalso referred to as business analytics , is a term used to describe a range of different\\napplications and technologies used to extract and analyze large amounts of data to aid indecision making. BI includes data-mining tools and querying tools, which are often\\ninteractive and visual. The growth of data-generating technologies such as RFID,combined with improvements in BI tools, has led to significant growth in the BI market. Prior\\nto 2008, almost all of SAP ’s ERP business came from traditional ERP suite applications.\\nHowever, in the period from 2008 to 2011, the percentage of the business that came from BI\\nrose to 50 percent.\\nFigure 8-1 shows a framework for how SAP views BI.\\nAccess\\nAnalytic\\napplications \\nCollaborationAnalytic capabilities\\nBusiness\\nintelligenceEnterprise\\nperformance\\nmanagement\\nGovernance,\\nrisk, and\\ncompliance\\nData\\nwarehousingEnterprise\\ninformation\\nmanagementData sources\\nSocial\\nmedia\\nSource Line: Course Technology/Cengage Learning.\\nFIGURE 8-1 SAP Business Intelligence (BI) framework\\nOn the left side of the diagram are the potential BI data sources, which are growing\\nboth in number and in the volume of data produced.

SAP BI includes a set of tools for\\nexploration, analysis, and presentation that can be applied to a wide range of businessquestions. Enterprise performance management is the concept of developing strategic\\ngoals for the organization and then gathering data to evaluate how the organization is\\nperforming in relation to those goals. The governance, risk, and compliance categoryrepresents a group of activities focused on ensuring an organization is functioning\\nethically and legally. Governance refers to the processes that ensure that top management\\nis receiving accurate and timely data necessary to run the organization and that controlmechanisms are in place to make sure that management directions and instructions are\\nbeing carried out. Risk, or risk management, consists of processes to identify risks to the\\norganization (technological, financial, information security, supply chain disruptions, andso on) and to develop plans to minimize the potential damage to these risks. Compliance\\nmeans conforming to stated requirements, which could be customer specifications for\\ngoods or services, Sarbanes-Oxley reporting requirements (discussed in Chapter 5), orstate and federal regulations such as those relating to product safety. Data warehousing is\\nthe technology used to store the large volumes of data used in the analysis. Enterprise\\ninformation management is a relatively new term that describes the business and\\ntechnology functions that manage information as a corporate asset.\\nThe final section of the diagram in Figure 8-1 is titled “Access, ”and it describes how\\nusers will access BI. Previously, this was primarily through personal computers, but with\\nthe growth in mobile technology, an increasing variety of devices can now be used to\\naccess BI.\\nIN-MEMORY COMPUTING\\nUp until recently, BI systems have typically accessed data that was stored on datawarehouse servers, which use hard disk technology to store data. Data stored in\\ndata warehouse servers usually consist of aggregated data —from an ERP system or other\\nsources. To speed access to this data, the data in a data warehouse are structured as\\nmultidimensional data cubes , which allow for relationships in the data to be analyzed\\nquickly. For example, a company might want to look at sales over time, by store, and by\\nproduct. This means analyzing sales along three dimensions, and the sales data would\\nneed to be structured as a three dimensional cube. If the company was also interested in\\nlooking at these sales by geographic region, it would need a four dimensional data cube.\\nThere are two main challenges with using a multidimensional cube structure. First,\\na significant level of technical expertise is needed to construct a cube, which means thatan IT specialist rather than an end user usually must complete this task. In practice,the end user and an IT specialist usually have to collaborate to construct the correct\\nmultidimensional data cube, and frequently they do not speak the same language —that is,\\nthe end user thinks in terms of business problems while the IT specialist thinks in terms\\nof database technology. Second, the multidimensional cube is a structure that necessarily\\nrestricts how the data can be analyzed.\\nIn Chapter 2, we introduced the topic of SAP ’s HANA in-memory computing\\ntechnology. HANA allows customers to analyze large amounts of data instantly. The key tothis technology is that data is stored in computer memory rather than on hard disk servers.220Chapter 8\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.The time required to access data from memory is a small fraction of the time required to\\naccess data from a hard disk. The primary performance measure for data storage systems is\\nlatency, which is the time between when a request is made for data from a storage device\\nand when the data is delivered. For hard disk storage, typical latency is currently around13 milliseconds. For memory, the latency is around 83 nanoseconds. To understand the\\nsignificance of this speed differential, think of in-computer memory as an F-18 fighter jet\\nthat can travel at a speed of 1,190 miles per hour and disk memory as a banana slug with atop speed of 0.007 miles per hour. With such a substantial difference in speed, the obvious\\nquestion is why would data warehouses use disk memory? The answer is storage capacity.\\nHard disk storage is now being measured in terabytes, while the maximum capacity ofmemory chips is still in the gigabytes —so hard disks can store one thousand times more\\ndata than memory for a comparable cost. While hard disks can store significantly more datathan memory chips, the cost and capacity of in-computer memory have reached levels atwhich in-memory BI is becoming more feasible.\\nData compression is another technology that makes in-memory BI possible. Figure 8-2\\nshows data for an SAP ERP data table used to store material master data. This is a typicalSAP ERP table; it consists of 223 data fields, which are the column headings.\\nMany\\ncolumns areblank or havezero values\\nSource Line: SAP AG.\\nFIGURE 8-2 Material master data table\\nAs shown in Figure 8-2, many of the fields, or columns, in the data table are blank or\\ncontain values of zero. By storing the data as columns rather than rows, in-memory\\nsystems can reduce the size of the data by eliminating the large numbers of blank or zero\\nvalues by just noting their positions in the table. Essentially the system says “this entire\\ncolumn is zero ”or“the next 100 items in this column are zero. ”When you look across\\nthe rows of the table, the number of zero or blank values are not as large, so the savingfrom noting zero or blank values are not nearly as large.\\nWith the data compression provided by column storage, it is now feasible to store\\nlarge volumes of data in memory without aggregation. This means that multidimensionalcubes are not required. An end user can analyze BI data “on the fly ”without needing an\\nIT specialist to translate the data into multidimensional cubes.221RFID, Business Intelligence (BI), Mobile Computing, and the Cloud\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

In February 2012,\\nOracle released its in-memory solution for business analytics called Exalytics. Both SAP ’s\\nand Oracle ’s in-memory solutions are designed to analyze what is now being termed\\n“big data. ”Big data refers to the enormous amount of data that is now available for BI use\\nfrom all the available sources, including ERP systems, Web sites, corporate databases,\\nscientific research, Twitter, and other social networking applications. Big data needs fast\\ncomputing to be usable, and in-memory computing allows for rapid processing. New chipsdesigns, such as chips made from carbon rather than silicon, may be the answer to\\ncreating even faster machines. Computing ’s processing is moving towards memory and\\naway from the processor, according to experts in the field such as John E. Kelly, the head\\nof IBM research. Big data is generating a lot of interest and investments from large\\ncompanies. The total investment in big data technology is in the billions of dollars, which\\nincludes investments by many companies other than SAP and Oracle, including IBM,Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard.\\nMany feel that BI and its capabilities are strategic assets to an organization that can\\nbe used to enhance future growth and viability, and some experts now say that companiesshould be hiring a chief data officer who can link the data with the computing power and\\nthe strategy of the organization.\\nAccording to Gartner Research, in 2011, only 30 percent of employees in\\norganizations with BI tools were actually using them. This low rate of use is due to thefact that BI software is often difficult to use and slow to perform, and the data is\\nsometimes of limited relevance for end users. Gartner anticipates that as BI toolsbecome easier to use, organizations with BI capabilities will have about 50 percent of\\ntheir workers using the software by the year 2015. Worldwide revenue in the business\\nintelligence, analytic applications, and performance management software market rose16 percent to $12.2 billion in 2011 from $10.5 billion in 2010, according to a report\\nfrom Gartner. SAP was the market leader in BI and analytics with a 24 percent market\\nshare. The report also showed that BI analytics was the top technology priority for CIOsin 2012.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nRecovery.gov\\nEven the federal government is getting into the BI arena. As part of the American\\nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (also known as the “Recovery Act ”),\\nthe Recovery.gov Web site was created to serve as “the U.S. government ’s official\\nwebsite that provides easy access to data related to Recovery Act spending and allowsfor the reporting of potential fraud, waste, and abuse.” With an interactive, user-friendly\\ninterface and a set of highly interactive BI tools, the site allows the average citizen toeasily review the various destinations for tax dollars spent under the Recovery Act. Thesite’s BI tools let users review preexisting charts and graphs or create their own. Filters\\nare available for the data, and the results can be emailed or exported. Figure 8-3 shows asample output of the top 10 states by funds awarded from the Recovery Act of 2009, asan example of a BI query.\\n(continued)222Chapter 8\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

United Parcel Service (UPS) uses complex computerizedevent processing to monitor the transactions related to the millions of packages it shipsdaily around the globe. In its old system, reports would be run each evening to monitorthe server loads on the computers that maintained these important transactions. If aproblem occurred, UPS would find out about it the next morning. With real-time BI,which includes easy-to-understand dashboards and analytics, problems are identifiedimmediately, and automatic emails are sent to alert employees of any problems with thecompany ’s computer systems.\\nAnother example of the use of real-time BI is at Insurance.com, where its new\\nIBM Cognos Now system helps the company cope with its e-commerce transactions. WithCognos Now, Insurance.com is able to monitor network performance and make anynecessary changes immediately. For example, when a new call comes in toInsurance.com ’s call center, the business intelligence system scans for available agents\\nand alerts the CRM software, which routes the call to one of the free agents.\\nQuestion:\\n1.

Often these efforts are driven by the expectations of young workerswho—having grown up with mobile computing and a myriad of mobile apps, such as\\nFacebook —are appalled at some companies ’existing legacy systems. It is predicted that by\\nthe year 2015, there will be more than 6.7 billion smartphones in the world, and a 2011survey conducted by CIO magazine found that 54 percent of the companies responding were\\nplanning to increase their spending on mobile applications. People are relying onsmartphones for social networking and shopping information, with the lines of work and playoften blurred. With today ’s smartphone —40 times more powerful than those in 2000 —and\\ncloud computing (discussed in the next section) making data available wherever a person is, itis not surprising there is pressure on companies to increase their support of mobile apps.\\nThere are, however, many challenges to face. For example, smartphones come in a\\nwide range of formats and operate on a variety of operating systems, and mobileapplications need to be developed with that in mind. Many experts agree that to developeffective applications, companies cannot simply take computer-based applications and\\nmodify them for use on mobile devices. Rather, mobile applications need to be developed\\nfrom scratch to take into account the limitations in screen size and user input capability.Companies must also set up a road map for implementation, deciding which applications\\nmay be high cost and low value (eliminate) or low cost and high value (adopt). There are\\nmany questions to answer as well: Should a company require its employees to usecompany-supplied devices, or should employees be allowed to supply their own\\nsmartphones? If employees are allowed to use their own smartphone, should a company\\nlimit the choice of devices or allow employees to choose the device they will use?Accenture Consulting, for example, estimates that 85,000 of its employees use\\nsmartphones, of which more than one-half are provided by the individual employee. If an\\nemployee supplies his or her own device, who will support it? Which carrier will be used?Security is always a concern, especially because most security breaches are caused by\\nusers not by technology. It has been estimated that only slightly over one-half of all\\nsmartphone users set up their password security on their phones. If a company does notdirectly support a device it might not be able to ensure that proper security measures are\\ntaken, which could allow for potential data breaches. Some organizations are attempting\\nto manage mobile devices from central servers, so if a device is lost or stolen, sensitivedata can be removed or the device can be wiped clean.\\nERP companies have provided mobile connections in the past, but most are ramping\\nup their offerings. For example, SAP recently acquired Sybase, a company with a platformcalled Sybase Unwired, which lets a company quickly develop mobile apps for almost any\\nmobile device. Another Sybase tool, Afaria, allows IT staff to manage those mobile apps\\ncentrally and push out new applications and updates remotely. If a device is lost or stolen,the central administrator can delete the application remotely.\\nAlthough mobile device apps are typically thought of as tools to provide users with\\ninformation, mobile devices can also be the source of information. For example, theincreasing sophistication of smartphones is leading people to use their smartphones —\\nrather than dedicated GPS devices— for navigation. Smartphone users can also subscribe\\nto traffic information services that may use static sensors or traffic cameras to augmentthe built-in maps so users can avoid accidents and rush-hour traffic. Increasingly, this224Chapter 8\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

For example, when a\\nuser of the Google Maps for mobile application chooses to enable the My Location option,\\nwhich shows the user ’s location on the map, it sends anonymous bits of data back to\\nGoogle describing how fast the user is moving. By combining the data of thousands of\\nphones moving around a city at any given time, Google can provide an accurate picture of\\nlive traffic conditions. This traffic data is then provided to mobile users in the Google\\nMaps traffic layers.\\nANOTHER LOOK\\nCorporate and Military Apps\\nCompanies are now using mobile applications (apps) in unique ways, and many\\ncompanies are creating their own internal app stores. For example, the pharmaceuticalcompany, Pfizer, has an app that helps employees who are traveling find and contactother Pfizer employees who are also traveling. Aflac, an insurance company, has an appthat allows claims adjusters to see data and coordinate insurance claims on a mobiledevice without having to go to a computer and log onto the main enterprise system. Fordisaster recovery, Deloitte Consulting created an app called Bamboo, which can pushemergency information out to employees ’smartphones in the event of an emergency.\\nDeloitte is implementing the app internally, and in the future, the firm plans to offer it toits customers.\\nThe military is also a major potential user of specialized mobile devices and apps.\\nHarris, an electronics and communications company is working on an app for tabletcomputers, such as Apple ’s iPad, to control the remote camera on an Unmanned Aerial\\nVehicle (UAV). While there are durability issues with using a commercial tablet in harshenvironments, it could make economic sense to use a $400 tablet in a rugged caseinstead of a $10,000 wireless receiver. If a tablet breaks, it is much cheaper to replace.In addition, because these devices are familiar to many young soldiers from theirpersonal experience, training costs are reduced.\\nIn April 2011, Textron announced that the U.S. Army was beginning tests of\\nSoldierEyes, a smartphone-based battle analysis and tracking system the company hasbeen developing. According to Textron, this application would allow every soldier to act asa sensor. Using this application, soldiers could collect and report real-time mission criticaldata, incorporating photos and video, which can be linked to the geographic location of thesoldier. With SoldierEyes, this information can be communicated (via the SoldierEyesApplication Cloud) to existing command, control, communications, intelligence, andsurveillance systems using 3G/4G cellular and Wi-Fi networks. For remote areas wherethese networks are not available, Textron has developed a secure mobile battlefieldcellular network called FASTCOM, which can use manned and unmanned aircraft,aerostats (tethered blimps), or ground vehicles to provide cellular coverage.\\nQuestion:\\n1.

The user typically accesses the cloud product through a Web\\nbrowser or a lightweight (meaning small and simple) application for a computer or mobiledevice. Cloud computing is not a completely new concept, rather it simply represents the\\nlatest stage of the development of computing and the Internet. To better understand how\\ncloud computing will impact ERP system development, it is useful to review thedevelopment of SAP ’s ERP systems with the advent of the Internet.\\nSAP and the Internet\\nIn 1996, SAP introduced its joint Internet strategy with Microsoft. The core of SAP ’s first\\neffort to integrate the Internet with its products was the Internet Transaction Server (ITS)a server-based software system that enabled efficient communication between an SAP ERPsystem and the Internet. To provide some context for the state of the Internet at this\\ntime —in 1996, Amazon.com was only one year old, and the online travel agencies Expedia\\nand Travelocity were both just being founded. Many other Internet services we take for\\ngranted today did not exist at this time.\\nIn May 1999, SAP announced mySAP.com, a new strategy designed to completely\\nrealign the company and its product portfolio. The goal of this initiative was to combinee-commerce solutions with SAP ’s existing ERP applications, using cutting-edge Web\\ntechnology. In 2000, SAP began building on the mySAP.com vision by adding thecapability for electronic marketplaces and corporate portals.\\nNetWeaver\\nIn 2004, SAP introduced its first version of SAP NetWeaver, a collection of components thatsupport business transactions over the Internet by providing seamless connectivity of diverse\\napplications. By the end of the year, over 1,000 customers had acquired the product. With\\nthe introduction of NetWeaver, SAP announced that it was planning its future initiativesaround the concept of enterprise service-oriented architecture (enterprise SOA), with a goal\\nof making all of its business applications service based —to provide its customers with the most\\nflexibility possible.\\nE-commerce needs are driving companies to connect their business applications, such\\nas ERP systems, both internally and externally through the Internet. Software designedwith an SOA can be quickly deployed and reconfigured as business conditions requirechanges to the applications, databases, and other infrastructure hosted in data centers\\nowned by a company. The combination of software tools that enables an organization’ s\\nvarious systems and applications to communicate with other applications is called\\nWeb services . SAP ’s NetWeaver is a Web services platform that allows various vendor\\napplications to share data over the Internet.\\nCompanies continue to warm to the idea of Web services and SOA. Information Age’ s\\n“Effective IT ”research report found that 50 percent of enterprises have some sort of SOA\\nstrategy. One benefit of adopting SOA is the ability to quickly add new applications,making the organization more responsive. SOA also relies on open standards, allowingeasier integration of software and offering the potential to reuse computer code, which can\\nreduce the time and cost of implementing new systems. This aspect of SOA is certainly\\nenticing, especially when compared with traditional systems that are often cumbersome226Chapter 8\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.and time consuming to implement. However, implementing SOA is not easy. The IT\\nanalyst group Ovum reported that one in five U.S. companies implementing SOA have\\nexperienced “unexpected complexity. ”\\nThe return on an SOA investment is often difficult to determine. According to a study\\npublished by Nucleus Research, only 37 percent of 106 organizations polled claimed thattheir SOA projects had a positive ROI. Respondents indicated that the main benefit of\\nSOA was the ability to reuse computer code.\\nNetWeaver Tools and Capabilities\\nSAP’s NetWeaver platform is a collection of modules, including Enterprise Portal, Mobile\\nInfrastructure, Business Intelligence, Master Data Management, and Exchange\\nInfrastructure.\\nThe SAP Enterprise Portal gives users complete access to all their work on a single\\nscreen, using links to connect users to all the major applications needed to perform theirjobs. The Enterprise Portal acts as a central access point to a company ’s intranet (its\\nsecure, internal network), operating through a secure link on a browser. For example, a\\nuser in the Finance Department could set up Enterprise Portal with links to SAP ERP\\nfinancial transaction processes, as well as links to financial metrics for the company, stock\\nmarket indices, email, a calendar, and other information important for that person ’s job.\\nThe advantage of having a personalized portal is its efficiency. A user only has to log\\non to one system to get all the information needed to perform his or her job. Without aportal, users often have to log on to multiple systems, such as an ERP system, email,industry exchanges, or suppliers ’sites. Transferring information between systems is\\nfrequently difficult. With the Enterprise Portal, all information is available through theWeb services provided by NetWeaver. All the important links are presented in one screen,and transferring data is simplified by the ability to “drag-and-relate ”data from one area\\nto another.\\nNetWeaver ’s Mobile Infrastructure module allows users to access and work with data\\nthrough mobile devices such as smartphones and pagers. Mobile Infrastructure provides\\nremote access to data within a company ’s SAP system and other information systems. The\\nbenefits are obvious. A salesperson could use his or her smartphone to see a customer ’s\\nhistorical order information while in the middle of a sales call with that customer.Connecting SAP and VoiceObjects AG adds voice capability to NetWeaver, allowing users\\nto enter data into the SAP CRM system using voice commands from their cell phones.Linking the SAP and VoiceObjects AG systems can be done without middleware or any\\nchanges to the software.\\nAnother facet of NetWeaver is the linkage with SAP ’s Business Intelligence (BI) data\\nwarehouse and analytical tools. With the Enterprise Portal, BI can be delivered in apersonalized fashion. It can integrate information from various sources and processes,\\nboth within and outside of the firm. BI works with any database management software andany operating system that is running NetWeaver.\\nAnother NetWeaver module, Master Data Management, provides data consistency\\nwithin a company ’s SAP system. NetWeaver allows a seamless Web interface to ensure\\nproper data synchronization. While this interface simplifies the data synchronization\\nprocess, it is not automatic —users with the proper knowledge and skills are still needed to\\nmanage this process.227RFID, Business Intelligence (BI), Mobile Computing, and the Cloud\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

By adhering to the standard of the Exchange Infrastructure, companies can eliminate\\nthe need to write code to enable different applications to share data. For example, using\\nExchange Infrastructure, a business can keep its current electronic data interchange (EDI)system and seamlessly integrate that with its ERP system. SAP ’s Web Application Server,\\nthe development environment that is the foundation of NetWeaver, gives ExchangeInfrastructure its customizability.\\nNetWeaver at Work for Fitter\\nNow we will examine how NetWeaver could help Fitter. Assume that Fitter has an SAPERP system and that Fitter ’s two top salespeople, Amy Sanchez and Donald Brown, are\\nbusy selling NRG bars directly to customers and to distributors. Amy works from home,and she logs on to the SAP system with her laptop computer, using the SAP GUI. She doesnot know much about the SAP system, nor does she have to. She needs to know how to\\nplace customer orders and check on their status. When Amy goes on a sales call, she\\nbrings her calculator and notepad with her to determine quote prices and jot down orderdetails. When she returns home, she plugs those numbers into the SAP system and\\nconfirms her quotes. Amy would like to have some additional information on how\\nsalespeople in other regions are doing and what mix of bars they are promoting, but shedoes not know how to access any of that information. She also would like to see if there\\nare new ways to market to her customers.\\nDonald Brown sells Fitter ’s BRG bars to distributors, and he has been chosen by his\\nmanager to test SAP NetWeaver for possible implementation at Fitter. With this newcapability, Donald’ s work day has changed dramatically. During the test, Donald logs on to\\nhis Enterprise Portal, which was tailored for his job, using his office computer. When he\\ndoes so, he can see his email, sales figures from his top 10 customers, data on production\\nand inventory, the current stock quote for Fitter on the NASDAQ exchange, the current\\nmarket price for oats, wheat germ, and honey, and the local weather report. Today,Donald will make an important sales call for a regional grocery chain. He grabs his\\nsmartphone and some extra business cards, and heads out the door. During lunch with the\\npurchasing manager for the grocery chain, Donald is able to check up-to-the-minutedetails on current sales orders and can confirm promises to ship additional bars to the\\ncustomer next week, thanks to SAP ’s Mobile Infrastructure. Back at the office, Donald calls\\nup the Business Intelligence module in NetWeaver. From there, he can run a few reports\\nto find out which snack bars are selling best nationwide, grouped by region and time of\\nyear. He can also analyze snack bar sales using data mining, to find sales patterns that can\\nhelp him plan future sales calls.\\nExercise 8.1\\n1.

Some people describe SaaS as a utility, similar to a telephone or\\nelectric company. It is simply a way to sell and distribute software that uses the\\nInternet. While definitions vary, this book treats SaaS as a subset of cloud computing.\\nFor example, Amazon and Apple are promoting data storage “on the cloud, ”but the\\napplications that use that data are stored on the device, updated regularly from thecloud (Internet).\\nA recent Forrester Research report claims that the analytics portion of SaaS will\\nbecome highly important to the users of this software delivery model. Users will be also belooking for SaaS applications that can integrate social media with a company ’s other\\nsources of information. According to the report, adopters of SaaS should also consider\\nhow their service providers can handle mobile apps.\\nSAP Business ByDesign\\nOne example of SaaS for the ERP market is SAP ’s Business ByDesign. First released in\\n2007, Business ByDesign is a full ERP system delivered to customers via the cloud. For\\nsmall to medium-sized companies, it lowers the total cost of ownership of the software and\\nenables a rapid and smooth implementation.

The lower cost to implement software provided through SaaS\\nmeans that companies can explore whether a particular software package will\\nwork for them without a large, up-front expense.\\n\\x81Shorter implementation time —The time required for implementation is\\nusually shorter with the SaaS model as the user does not have to worry aboutthe technical issues; the provider has servers, telecommunications systems,230Chapter 8\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

The SaaS provider handles all\\nthe maintenance, including execution of backups, training, and customizing\\nof the system.\\n\\x81Lower support costs and complexity —Companies that make use of the SaaS\\nmodel do not need to hire additional IT personnel to implement new systemsand applications. SaaS providers can also run information systems more\\nefficiently because they do it on a large scale; they can spread fixed costsover many users, thus achieving economies of scale that translate into a\\nlower total cost of ownership. In addition, an SaaS provider usually has an\\neasier time attracting, training, and retaining a talented workforce than asmall manufacturing company like Fitter.\\nDisadvantages of Using SaaS\\nThere are some potential downsides to using SaaS, and companies should consider these\\ncarefully before choosing an SaaS provider:\\n\\x81Security —Companies using SaaS are turning their information systems over\\nto a third party. They must be confident that the SaaS provider has a high\\nlevel of security. An SaaS provider wi ll typically have data from multiple\\nclients on a single piece of hardware. Each customer’ sd a t am u s tb e\\nshielded from other customers. Although this is a legitimate area of concernfor clients looking to move to the Sa aS model, the reality is that SaaS\\nproviders often have better security systems in place than many smallcompanies do.\\n\\x81Bandwidth/response time —The telecommunications channel from the SaaS\\nprovider to its customers must be fast enough to handle multiple users, andthe SaaS must have sufficient hardware to provide the necessary computerprocessing capabilities.\\n\\x81Flexibility —T h eS a a Sp r o v i d e rs h o u l db ef l e x i b l ei nw o r k i n gw i t hi t s\\nusers and satisfying their requests for software modifications andenhancements.\\n\\x81No frills— SaaS software providers can usually provide basic systems well,\\nbut asking for unusual configurations may cause problems, and the SaaSprovider might not allow for third-party add-ons. Further, the provider\\nmight not want to develop custom softw are, or it may not be affordable for\\na small company.\\n\\x81Technical, not business focus —An SaaS provider will understand the\\ntechnical aspects of the software it is delivering, but it may not have\\nsufficient business process knowledge, in which case the customerwill need to define the business processes and make configuration\\ndecisions.231RFID, Business Intelligence (BI), Mobile Computing, and the Cloud\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

In particular, Plex provides a complete, cloud-based ERP solutionfor manufacturing companies. Plex moved to cloud computing in 2000 and developed itscloud strategy using the multi-tenant model versus a hosted environment. In a hostedenvironment, a separate system is created and managed for each customer, while in a multi-tenant model, there is only one system and each customer is a tenant in the system.\\nPlex chose this approach because it wanted to leverage customer enhancements.\\nBecause there is only one copy of the Plex system, whenever an improvement is made toit, the update is available to all tenants. Plex makes sure enhancements are designedto add functionality that might be valuable to multiple customers, but customers are notrequired to adopt every update. Customers can choose whether or not to adopt a changethrough simple configuration settings.\\nWhile manufacturing environments are complex, Plex decided that users needed a\\nsimple interface design for the shop floor. The simple interface makes the software easyto use. In addition, the interface is configurable so individual users can organize iconsand buttons and control them with user authorizations as they are provided with Plex ’s\\nscreen building tool. A sample Plex screen is shown in Figure 8-6.\\nSource Line: Plex Systems.\\nFIGURE 8-6 Sample Plex screen\\n(continued)232Chapter 8\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Many ERP companies\\nprice their software on a per-user basis. Plex saw a problem with this approach: it\\nencouraged companies to limit the number of people who would interact with the\\nsoftware. Plex, however, wanted to encourage customers to use software. In addition, thecompany wanted to match its pricing to the real costs of transactions processed. In aseat license model, a customer may minimize users but have the same volume oftransactions as a customer with many more users. Plex prices its software based on thesize of the business, whether measured by company revenue or total number ofemployees. Plex adjusts the amount of the subscription on a yearly cycle. If a companysuffers a downturn in business —and its revenue or number of employees is reduced —\\nthen its subscription is reduced. Of course, if the customer grows, so does itssubscription.\\nPlex has observed an interesting phenomenon with its customers. At first, new\\ncustomers are hesitant to use a cloud system —they are concerned about data integrity\\nwhen all customers reside in a single system. But after a while, customers typicallyrealize that other Plex customers actually form a community, and collaboration withinthe Plex community provides value. Rather than being a software company that is salesand marketing driven, Plex has become a company where users, and the usercommunity, directly drive innovation, and all customers benefit.\\nQuestions:\\n1. How will SaaS affect large ERP companies such as SAP and Oracle? Will their\\nsize and research capabilities allow SAP and Oracle to gain dominance ofthe SaaS marketplace, or will ERP systems be provided by a growing numberof small companies, such as Plex, each providing specialized ERP packagesspecially tailored for specific industries?\\n2. Will Fortune 500 companies eventually leave SAP ERP for SaaS systems? Will\\nthey adopt SaaS products from smaller providers? Will they use BusinessByDesign? Or will companies like SAP and Oracle migrate their current largeERP packages to an SaaS environment?\\nExercise 8.2\\nReturning to the example company, Fitter, assume that under its newly appointed CIO,\\nFitter has made the decision to acquire an ERP system. Now the CIO must decide how to\\nimplement the system. After talking with various ERP software vendors, the CIO hasdetermined that Fitter has two options for implementing ERP software:\\n1. Buy a license for the ERP software, purchase the hardware required to run it,\\nand hire and train system administrators.\\n2. Run Fitter ’s ERP system over the Web through an SaaS provider, which\\nwould deliver ERP services for a monthly fee.\\nBoth types of implementations have advantages and disadvantages, as you have\\nalready seen. For the first part of this exercise, you must write a memo to the CIO\\nenumerating the pros and cons of each method. Use a table similar to the one shown in\\nFigure 8-7 to organize your thoughts.233RFID, Business Intelligence (BI), Mobile Computing, and the Cloud\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning.

He would like you to prepare a spreadsheet that analyzes the\\nfinancial impact of both scenarios. You need to compare the monthly cost of using the\\nSaaS provider with the total cost of purchasing an ERP system that would run on Fitter ’s\\nservers. Weigh the pros and cons of each method, and then make a recommendation,\\nwhich the CIO will present to the chief financial officer of Fitter. As you work through\\nthese calculations, keep in mind that Fitter ’s net income is $3.4 million (you can find\\nmore details in Chapter 5). The following sections provide you the financial details you\\nshould take into consideration.\\nOption 1: Buying Computers and Software Rights for an ERP System\\nTo set up its own ERP system, Fitter must buy the following:\\n\\x81Database server —The server would cost $70,000.\\n\\x81Application server —Fitter needs a server to run the ERP application, which\\nwould cost about $40,000.\\n\\x81PCs—Some of Fitter ’s existing PCs could be loaded with the ERP software ’s\\nGUI and be used to access the system. Because more Fitter employees will be\\nconnected to the new system, however, Fitter will need 10 additional\\ncomputers. Total cost for the PCs would be $15,000.\\n\\x81Computer maintenance —Fitter needs to make sure all its PCs and servers\\nrun properly. To do this, Fitter would purchase a maintenance contract tocover all hardware. This contract would cost about $1,000 a month, or\\n$12,000 yearly, and is in addition to any costs Fitter currently incurs tomaintain its existing hardware.\\n\\x81Licensing rights —Licensing rights to the ERP software for all users for five\\nyears would cost $500,000. The CIO does not know whether further outlayswill be required after the fifth year, and therefore is limiting the analysis to\\nthe years 2013 through 2017.\\n\\x81Installation —The ERP vendor will help install the system, but Fitter also\\nneeds to hire consultants for the six-month implementation. At $3,000 perday, the cost is estimated at $486,000.\\n\\x81User training —Included with the purchase of the rights to the ERP software\\nis training at a local training center for key personnel involved in the ERPimplementation project. Fitter wants further training, however, for Fitter-\\nspecific business practices. The additional training will cost $2,000 per day234Chapter 8\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

This includes a training consultant to run classes at Fitter\\nheadquarters. With travel and lodging, the total cost is $23,000.\\n\\x81Ongoing consulting —Once the system is up and running, Fitter will need to\\npay for consultants to help maintain the system. Fitter believes that havingconsultants come in once a month should be sufficient for handling ongoing\\nissues such as bug resolution and minor updates to the system. The\\nconsulting fees are estimated to be $3,000 per day, with a total annual costof $36,000.\\n\\x81Network and database administrator —Fitter would need a full-time network\\nand database administrator to run the system. Salary, including benefits, fora skilled person is $200,000 per year.\\nOption 2: Using an SaaS Provider to Deliver ERP Software\\nThe other option available to Fitter is to use an SaaS provider to deliver ERP software.\\nEstimated costs for this option are as follows:\\n\\x81PCs—Fitter estimates that it would still need to purchase 10 new PCs with\\nthis option because many more users will now be accessing the computer\\nsystem. Each PC costs $1,500, for a total of $15,000.\\n\\x81Computer maintenance —The maintenance contract on the additional PCs\\nwould be $600 per month, or $7,200 yearly. Because Fitter would not need topurchase additional servers, the maintenance costs are less with this option.\\n\\x81Software through the SaaS provider —The monthly cost of delivering ERP\\nsoftware to Fitter over the Web is $33,333 —or $400,000 yearly.\\n\\x81User training —Training of Fitter employees is provided by the SaaS provider\\nas part of the monthly software fee.\\nCalculate the NPV and Make a Recommendation\\nInthe next part of this exercise, you will set up a spreadsheet to total all the costs of each\\noption. In each scenario, you must deal with the net present value (NPV) of money.\\nNPV is a way to figure out whether an investment is profitable, or in this case, to\\ncompare outlay of funds from one method to another. NPV addresses the time value of\\nmoney —that is, being paid one dollar today is worth more than being paid one dollar a\\nyear from now. Because of the time value of money, if a firm is borrowing the money for\\nan investment, they have to pay interest on that money. If they have cash on hand to\\nfinance the investment, the company still needs to consider that the cash could beinvested in other ways that would pay the firm interest. When analyzing an investment, a\\nfirm must consider the time value of money, and performing a NPV calculation is a\\ncommon way to do that by adjusting future earning or expenses based on an assumedinterest rate. When calculating two different investment options, the NPV calculation\\nallows different future expenses or earnings to be calculated as an equivalent amount in\\nthe present time. For example, earning $10,000 dollars one year from now might beequivalent to having $9,345.79 today. NPV can be calculated over a number of years; in\\nour case, we need a five-year outlay of funds for the ERP project. In an Excel spreadsheet,\\nthe syntax of the NPV calculation is = NPV (hurdle rate percentage, range of values) . The\\nvalues in the range can be positive or negative numbers. In our case, they are all outflows,235RFID, Business Intelligence (BI), Mobile Computing, and the Cloud\\nCopyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

This data canprovide real business value, but the challenge is how to manage and evaluate this data to\\ngain business knowledge.\\n\\x81Business intelligence (BI) tools are growing in sophistication and power. Technologies such\\nasin-memory computing will provide greater speed and flexibility to BI users and will\\nincrease the number of employees in a company that can make use of BI.\\n\\x81Mobile computing technology is increasing the use of ERP and BI data by making it moreconvenient to access data when and where it is needed.\\n\\x81Cloud computing is the delivery of a software product to a user via the Internet. The usertypically accesses the cloud product through a Web browser or a lightweight (meaning\\nsmall and simple) application for a computer or mobile device.\\n\\x81Web services and service-oriented architecture offer a combination of software tools thatenables various programs within an organization to communicate with other applications.\\n\\x81SAP ’s Web services platform is NetWeaver, which is a collection of components that\\nsupport business transactions over the Internet by providing seamless connectivity ofdiverse applications through the Internet. NetWeaver also includes modules such as\\nEnterprise Portal, Mobile Infrastructure, Business Intelligence, Master Data Management,\\nand Exchange Infrastructure.\\n\\x81Software as a service (SaaS) is a software delivery model in which a software product is\\nhosted by a company —such as SAP— on its servers and is accessed by customers via a\\nWeb browser. The SaaS model allows companies to use ERP without a large initial\\ninvestment, making ERP systems available to smaller companies. SaaS solutions allow for\\nmore rapid improvements in the software through user communities. There are risks\\nassociated with using an SaaS provider, however, and the decision to buy or lease must beweighed carefully.\\nKey Terms\\nbusiness intelligence (BI)\\ncloud computingenterprise information managementmultidimensional data cubesradio frequency identification (RFID)service-oriented architecture (SOA)software as a service (SaaS)Web services\\nExercises\\n1.

The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. Additionally, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.'"
